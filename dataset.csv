How can I deploy my backend and then connect it to the frontend deployed in github pages?,"To deploy a backend service on Choreo and connect it to a frontend hosted on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Deploy the Backend Service on Choreo\n1. Create a Project in Choreo:\n   * Go to the Choreo Console and sign in.\n   * On the organization home page, click **+ Create Project**.\n   * Enter a display name, unique name, and description for the project.\n   * Click **Create** to create the project and open the project home page.\n\n2. Connect Your GitHub Repository and Configure the Service:\n   * On the project home page, click **Start** under **Create Multiple Components**.\n   * Go to the **GitHub** tab.\n   * Click **Authorize with GitHub** to allow Choreo to connect to your GitHub account.\n   * Enter the GitHub account details, repository, and branch.\n   * In the **Add Component Directories** pane, click the + icon corresponding to your backend service directory.\n   * Configure the service component by specifying details such as Component Display Name, Component Name, Path, Component Type, Buildpack, and Language Version.\n   * Click **Save** and then **Finish** to initialize the service.\n\n3. Build and deploy the service\n   3.1: Build\n   * On the project home page, click the service component you created. This takes you to the component overview page.\n   * In the left navigation, click **Build**.\n   * Click **Build Latest**. The build process may take a while, and you can track the progress via the logs in the Build Details pane.\n   * Once the build process is complete, the build status changes to Success.\n\n   3.2: Deploy\n   * In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n   * On the **Set Up** card, click **Configure & Deploy**.\n   * In the **Environment Configurations** pane, click **Next**.\n   * In the **File Mount** pane, click **Next**.\n   * Review the **Endpoint Details** and click **Deploy**. In the Endpoint Details pane that opens, ensure that the Network Visibility is set to Public. This setting securely exposes the endpoint for external consumption.\n   * The deployment process may take some time, and you can track the progress by observing the logs.\n   * Once the deployment is complete, the build status changes to Active on the Development environment card.\n\n   Ensure that your backend service is configured to allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests from your frontend's domain (GitHub Pages). \n   This is crucial for enabling communication between the two different domains.\n   To do that follow these steps\n\n   3.3.: Enable CORS\n   * From your Development card access endpoint details. \n   * In the Endpoint Details pane Go to settings. \n   * From the security tab in the settings you can allow CORS.\n\nTo connect your service to the frontend deployed outside choreo in this case github pages you need to get the public url for your service.\n\n4. Getting the Public URL:\n   * Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the component overview page where you can find the service URL.\n   * Copy the public URL of the service from the development environment card.\n\n5. Then you have to manually add this public URL as the API URL in your frontend code.\n   Use this API URL in your frontend to make HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) to interact with your backend service."

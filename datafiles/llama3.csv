How to deploy a webapp?,"To deploy a webapp in Choreo, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create a Web Application Component**

Create a Web Application component and connect it to a Git repository that includes the implementation of the Web Application. You can deploy different types of web applications, such as Single Page Applications (SPAs), web servers, and static content.

**Step 2: Deploy the Web Application Component**

1. In the left menu, click **Deploy**.
2. In the **Build Area** card, click **Deploy Manually**.
3. The deployment may take a few minutes to complete.

**Step 3: Monitor the Deployment Progress**

1. Check the deployment progress by observing the console logs on the right of the page.
2. You can access the following scans under **Build**:
	* **The Dockerfile scan**: Choreo performs a scan to check if a non-root user ID is assigned to the Docker container to ensure security.
	* **Container (Trivy) vulnerability scan**: This detects vulnerabilities in the final docker image.

**Step 4: Access Your Web Application**

1. Once the web application is deployed, copy the **Web App URL** from the development environment card.
2. Navigate to the web app URL to verify that the web app is successfully hosted.

**Note**: If you have Choreo environments on a private data plane, you can ignore vulnerabilities detected by the container scan and proceed with the deployment.

Refer to the following documentation for more information:
- [Create and Deploy a Web Application](doc_link)
- [Deploying a Web Application Component](doc_link)

Please let me know if you need more information.","['\nA Web Application is an application program that is hosted on a server and serves ingress traffic through the browser. In Choreo, you can deploy a web application by creating a Web Application component and connecting it to a Git repository that includes the implementation of the Web Application. A Web Application can be one of the following:\n\n- Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.\n- Web servers that serve static content or provide server-side rendering/static site generation (SSR/SSG).\n- Static content, such as websites and other static resources that do not require a backend. These resources are usually just static HTML/JS/CSS files that need to be hosted.\n', '\n1. To deploy a web application component, you will need a GitHub account with a repository that contains a web application. Fork the [Choreo sample apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/), which contains the sample for this guide.\n2.

"How to resolve ""Module not found error"" during the deployment of a Python project?","Unfortunately, the provided documentation does not contain information on resolving the ""Module not found error"" during the deployment of a Python project. The available documentation seems to be related to general information about Choreo, troubleshooting a blank page or 502 error after deploying a web application, and configuring a local environment for a seamless development experience with the Choreo extension.

However, I can suggest some general steps that might help resolve the ""Module not found error"" during deployment:

*   Verify that the required modules are installed in your project's virtual environment.
*   Check that the module is correctly imported in your Python code.
*   Ensure that the module is included in the project's requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt`).

If you're still experiencing issues, I recommend checking the Choreo documentation or reaching out to their support team for more specific guidance on resolving the ""Module not found error"" during deployment.

Here are some relevant doc links that might be helpful:

*   [Choreo Documentation](https://choreo.dev/docs/) (general documentation)
*   [Troubleshooting](https://choreo.dev/docs/troubleshooting/) (troubleshooting guide)

Please note that these links are general and might not directly address the ""Module not found error"" issue.","['\nUsing Choreo, you can easily deploy applications written in different language frameworks (such as Java, Go, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.) on shared or private data planes.\n\nChoreo supports deploying applications with buildpacks for the following component types:\n\n- Service\n- Web Application\n- Scheduled Task\n- Manual Task\n- Webhook\n- Event Handler\n- Test Runner\n', '\n- **I’m seeing a blank page or a 502 error after I deploy my web application**\n\n    If you encounter a blank page or a 502 error after deploying your web application, it typically indicates that the wrong directory is being served. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n\n    - Double-check the build output directory, especially if you are using a Dockerfile-less preset. Ensure that the specified output directory matches the actual output directory generated during the build process. For example, erroneously if you have entered `public/` as the output directory when it should have been `build/`.\n\nBy verifying and correcting the output directory alignment, you should be able to address the issue of seeing a blank page or experiencing a 502 error after deploying your web application.', '\nComponents belong to a project in Choreo and environments are provisioned per project as well.

You will use a simple reading list web application with a sign-in page and functionality to interact with a secure backend service. You will also use Choreo's managed authentication to easily set up authentication for your web application without having to dive into the details of security protocols. The application will allow users to sign in and view their reading lists, add books to a reading list, delete books from the reading list, and sign out of the application effortlessly.\n\nThis guide walks you through the following steps:\n\n- Develop, deploy, and test a service component.\n- Create a web application to consume the exposed service.\n- Create a connection to the deployed service.\n- Enable managed authentication and deploy the web application.\n- Consume the deployed service via the web application.\n\n"", '\nTo enable external IdP authentication for APIs,  create an API on Azure AD that represents the API on Choreo. Follow the steps below: \n\n1. Sign in to the Azure console.\n2. Follow the [Azure guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) to create a Web API that represents your API on Choreo.\n3. In the left navigation menu, under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**.\n4. Add the default **Application ID URI** and click **Save and Continue**.\n5. Under **Scopes defined by this API**, select **Add a scope**.\n6. Enter the fully qualified name as the **scope name**. \n7. Define who can consent. You can alternatively [add a scope requiring admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope-requiring-admin-consent).\n8. Enter appropriate values and click **Add Scope**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: \n\n- [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)\n- [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose a web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)\n\n### Step 2.1: Assign users to the web API\n\nYou can restrict users to the API as follows: \n\n1. Go to your Azure AD main menu. \n2. Under **Manage**,  click on **Enterprise Applications**. Alternatively, on Microsoft Entra, under **Applications**, click **Enterprise Applications**.\n3. Select your API. \n4. Under **Manage**, select the **Users and groups** then select **+ Add user/group**.\n5. Select the users and groups and click **Select**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access](Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access)\n', '\nTo secure your web application, you must implement authentication and authorization for it. \n\nTo easily set up authentication for your web application with Choreo\'s managed authentication, follow the steps given below. You can also refer to a sample [React app with managed authentication](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end-with-managed-auth).  \n\n### Step 1.1: Implement the sign-in functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-in functionality for your web application, you must implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n``` javascript\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>\n```\n\nThis code snippet works as follows:\n\nWhen a user clicks sign in on your web application, Choreo will redirect the user to the preconfigured identity provider and handle the authentication process, conforming to the OICD/OAuth2.0 protocols. On successful sign-in, Choreo will set the relevant session cookies and redirect the user to the post-sign-in path (default is `/`). The user can then invoke any Choreo-deployed APIs depending on the permission granted.\n\n### Step 1.2: Obtain user information claims\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication allows you to access user information claims that the identity provider returns post-sign-in, either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource.\n\n\n#### Obtain user information via the `userinfo` cookie\n\nUpon successful sign-in, Choreo\'s managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie that is accessible from the post-sign-in path you configured (by default, set to /). This `userinfo` cookie, provided by the identity provider, contains encoded user information claims.\n\n!!! note\n    - The `userinfo` cookie is intentionally set to have a short lifespan of only 2 minutes.\n    - As a developer, you can decide how to utilize the user information that you retrieve. You must securely store the user information because the stored information can also serve as a means to verify the logged-in state of a user.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0\n\nThe recommended approach is to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie. The following is a sample code snippet that you can include in your post-sign-in path to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie:\n\n``` javascript\n    import Cookies from \'js-cookie\';\n\n    // Read userinfo cookie value.\n    const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get(\'userinfo\')\n\n    // Decode the value. \n    const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\n\n    // Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\n\n    // Clear the cookie.\n    Cookies.remove(\'userinfo\', { path: <post-login-path> })\n```\n#### Obtain user information via a GET endpoint\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication provides the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo` in addition to the `userinfo` cookie that it sets after successful sign-in. You can use this endpoint to query information about users who have signed in. It also serves as a mechanism to check the state of a user who has signed in.\n\nThe following is an example of a request to this endpoint:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(\'/auth/userinfo\')\n```\n\nIf a user has signed in, the server sends a `200 OK` response with the user information in JSON format in the response body. However, if the user is not signed in, the server sends a `401 Unauthorized` response.\n\n### Step 1.3: Implement the sign-out functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-out functionality of your web application, you can implement a sign-out button to redirect users to the `/auth/logout` path along with the `session_hint` cookie value on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n!!! note\n    - It is recommended to clear any user information (if stored) at the time of sign-out.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0  \n    \n``` javascript\n<button onClick={async () => {\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get(\'session_hint\')}`;\n}}>Logout</button>`\n```\n\nWhen a user clicks the sign-out button, Choreo will clear the session cookies and redirect the users to the OIDC logout endpoint of the configured identity provider (if available).\xa0\xa0\n\n### Step 1.4: Invoke APIs\n\nTo invoke Choreo APIs within the same organization as your web application, you can use the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, regardless of whether managed authentication is enabled for the web application or not.\n\n!!! note\n    To invoke a Choreo API from a web application, you need to [create a Connection](../develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services.md#create-a-connection-to-a-service) from the web application to the Choreo API. \n\nFor example, if the API URL is `https://2d9ec1f6-2f04-4127-974f-0a3b20e97af5-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`, the `<api-suffix>` would be `/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`. You can invoke the API using the `/choreo-apis/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0` relative path from your single-page application.\n\n!!! info\n     To copy the exact service URL of a Connection, you can follow the steps given below:\n      1. In the Choreo Console, go to the appropriate web application component.\n      2. In the left navigation menu, click **Connections** under **Dependencies**.\n      3. Click on the required Connection and copy the service URL.\n\nIf you enable Choreo\'s managed authentication, you don\'t have to manually add any logic to attach an access token to the API call because Choreo APIs accept the cookies set by Choreo\'s managed authentication. You can directly invoke the API as follows:\n\n```\n    const response = await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\')\n```\n\nIf Choreo\'s managed authentication is disabled, you must ensure that your web application attaches a valid access token to the API call.\n\n\n### Step 1.5: Refresh session\n\nThe logged is user\'s session expires when the access token provided by the identity provider you have configured expires. After the session expires, the session must be refreshed to successfully call a Choreo-deployed API. For session refresh to function, you must set up the identity provider to issue a refresh token in addition to the access token.\n\n`401 Unauthorized` response status code for a Choreo API request from a logged in user with the necessary permissions indicates a possible session expiry. To refresh the session, you can make a POST request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", { method: ""POST"" })\n```\n\nIf the refresh token is valid, the session will be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `204 No Content` status.\n\nIf the refresh token has expired, the session will not be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status.\n\nTo automate the session refresh process on receiving a `401 unauthorized` response from the Choreo API, you can encapsulate the requests with the refresh logic. The following is an example code snippet that wraps GET requests:\n\n``` javascript\n    export const performGetWithRetry = async (url) => {\n        try {\n            // API call\n            return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n        } catch (error) {\n            if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\n                //Received 401 Unauthorized response from API GW. The access token may have expired.\n\n                // Try to refresh the token\n                const refreshResponse = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", {\n                    method: ""POST""\n                });\n\n                const status = refreshResponse.status;\n                if (status === 401) {\n                    // Session has expired (i.e., Refresh token has also expired).\n                    // Redirect to login page\n                    window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";\n                }\n                if (status !== 204) {\n                    // Tokens cannot be refreshed due to a server error.\n                    console.log(""Failed to refresh token. Status: "" + status);\n\n                    //  Throw the 401 error from API Gateway.\n                    throw error;\n                }\n                // Token refresh successful. Retry the API call.\n                return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n            } else {\n                throw error;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n### Step 1.6: Set up a custom error page\n\nYou can set up Choreo\'s managed authentication to redirect to a customized error page within your web application by defining the error path in the configuration. In the event of an error during a redirection-based process, such as sign in or sign out, Choreo will automatically redirect the user to the designated custom error page.\n\n!!! note\n    If you have not configured an error path, Choreo\'s managed authentication will use its default error page whenever an error occurs.\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication will include the following query parameters in the URL when redirecting to the custom error page:\n\n| Parameter      |  Description                                    |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| code           | A short textual error code indicating the error |\n| message        | The description of the error                    |\n\n\nNow have successfully implemented Choreo\'s managed authentication for your web application. The next step is to enable managed authentication for the component, and subsequently deploy it.\n', '\nYou can invoke the API/service using the credentials you created above. Since Choreo services are secured, you need to invoke the services securely with the help of your IdP. To invoke the API/service you created securely, you need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Create a web application in Choreo.\n2. Create an OAuth application in the IdP. \n3. Configure the web application to authenticate the API/service invocations from the IdP, and securely invoke the service/API in Choreo.\n4. Deploy the web application. \n\nIn this guide, you will be using the following product and examples:\n\n-  WSO2 Asgardeo as the IdP\n- [choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end) as the web application. This is a React SPA that invokes the service using Axios. This web application is configured to read the\n[choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-service](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-service) as the service. You can modify this web application to read your service, or [deploy the choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/quick-start-guides/build-your-first-cloud-native-application-with-choreo/#step-1-create-a-service-component-and-publish-it-as-a-rest-api) in Choreo and use it. \n\n### Step 1: Create a web application component\n\n!!! info\n    You can use your own web application implementation in place of the sample web application. For this exercise, let\'s use the [choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end) as the web application.\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/create-web-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n### Step 2: Create an OAuth application in the IdP\n\nTo invoke the service/API in Choreo you require a token. To obtain a token you need to create an OAuth application in the IdP. If you use any other IdP other than Asgardeo, create an OAuth application and set the following:\n\n-  **Allowed grant types**:  Code\n-  **Public client**: Mark as a public client in an application.\n-  **Authorized redirect URLs**: Enter the web app URL you copied earlier.\n-  **Allowed origins** field: Add the same URLs that you added as authorized redirect URLs.\n-  **Access Token**: Set  JWT as the Token type.\n\nChoreo uses Asgardeo as the default identity provider for Choreo applications. When you create an application in the Choreo Developer Portal, it automatically creates a corresponding application in Asgardeo. You can go to the Asgardeo application to specify the configurations required for end users to sign in to the front-end application. Follow the steps below to configure the Asgardeo OAuth application:\n\n1. Access Asgardeo at [https://console.asgardeo.io/](https://console.asgardeo.io/) and sign in with the same credentials with which you signed in to Choreo.\n2. Make sure you are in the same organization that you were when you created the application in the Choreo Developer Portal. You can click the **Organization** list in the Asgardeo Console top menu and ensure you are in the correct organization.\n3. In the Asgardeo Console\'s left navigation, click **Applications**. You will see the **readingListApp** that Choreo automatically created for you.\n4. Click on the edit icon to edit the application.\n5. Click the **Protocol** tab and apply the following changes:\n\n    1. Under **Allowed grant types**, select **Code**.\n    2. Select the **Public client** checkbox.\n    3. In the **Authorized redirect URLs** field, enter the web app URL you copied earlier and click the **+** icon to add the entry.\n    4. In the **Allowed origins** field, add the same URLs that you added as authorized redirect URLs.\n    5. Under **Access Token**, select **JWT** as the **Token type**.\n    6. Click **Update**.\n\n### Step 3: Configure the web application to connect to the IdP and invoke the service\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/configure-front-end-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n\n### Step 4: Deploy the web application\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/deploy-the-web-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n\nThat\'s it! You can use a user created in your IdP and invoke the service through your web application.', ""\nBefore you try out this guide, ensure you have set up the following:\n\n- Configure the Choreo built-in identity provider with users. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure a User Store with the Built-In Identity Provider](../administer/configure-a-user-store-with-built-in-idp.md).\n- Deploy and publish an API via Choreo. If you don't have an existing API in Choreo, you can either [develop a REST API](../develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-rest-api.md) or an [API Proxy](../develop-components/develop-an-api-proxy.md).\n- A web application for API subscription.

How can I add environment variables to python webapp?,"To add environment variables to a Python webapp in Choreo, follow these steps:

1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to define configurations and secrets.
2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Configs & Secrets**.
3. Click **+ Create**.
4. In the **Mount a Configuration** pane, do the following:
    1. Select a **Config Type** depending on your requirement.
    2. Select **File Mount** as the **Mount Type**.
    3. Click **Next**.
    4. In the **Config Name** field, specify a name for the file mount.

    !!! tip
    The configuration name you specify does not affect the environment variables you set. It is only a reference to identify the configuration or secret you create.

5. Add the necessary environment variables as key-value pairs. You can click **Add Item** to add any number of environment variables.

6. Click **Create**.

!!! note
Using environment variables is a recommended practice when developing integration artifacts with WSO2 Integration Studio, as it improves configuration management, security, portability, and manageability. By leveraging environment variables, organizations can streamline the management and maintenance of their integrations, ensuring that updates can be implemented quickly and efficiently.

For a comprehensive list of parameters that can be configured as environment variables, see [WSO2 API Manager Documentation - Injecting Parameters - Supported parameters](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/integrate/develop/injecting-parameters/#supported-parameters).

You can also refer to [Choreo Documentation - Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/) for more information on managing environment variables.

However, if you are using a Single Page Application (SPA) like React, Choreo does not support ‘baking-in’ environment variables or other configurations. Instead, you can manage runtime configurations by creating a config file and mounting it as a file mount in Choreo. For more information, see [Choreo Documentation - Manage Runtime Configurations for SPAs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop/components/run-your-component-at-runtime/#exposing-runtime-configuration-variables-to-your-spa).

Alternatively, you can also inject them into the client app during SSR or when serving static content.\n\nHowever, in the case of SPAs that run completely on the browser, Choreo does not support ‘baking-in’ environment variables or other configurations. This is because Choreo follows a multi-environment deployment model, where configuration should be kept separate from the build and injected at runtime. For example, in most React SPA frameworks, the process.env stub is available during build time. However, it does not actually read in variables from the runtime. Instead, it is baked into the final JavaScript output during the build process. \n\nFor managing runtime configurations, Choreo recommends the following approach (this is a React example, but will be generally applicable for other SPA frameworks).\n\n!!! note\n    - With SPAs, anything you mount as a runtime config will be available to your users in the browser. \n    - **Do not include sensitive secrets that are not browser-safe**.\n\n\nFollow the steps below to manage runtime configurations for the React application you created above:\n\n1. Go to your forked [Choreo sample apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/).\n2. Open the public directory.\n3. Create and commit a new file in the public directory of your React app called `config.js`. This file should contain any runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your app, such as API endpoints or feature flags. Let\'s expose the API URL and a feature flag as follows:\n\n    ```\n    window.config = {\n    apiUrl: \'https://api.example.com\',\n        featureFlags: {\n            enableNewFeature: true,\n            enableExperimentalFeature: false,\n        },\n    };\n    ```\n2. In your index.html file inside the public directory , add a script tag as follows to include the config.js file inside the <body> tag, so that this config.js file will be accessible via JavaScript at runtime.\n\n    ```\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=""en"">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=""utf-8"" />\n        <title>My React App</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=""root""></div>\n        <script src=""%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js""></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n    ```\nThis will make the `window.config` object available to your app at runtime.\n\n3. In your React component, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object as follows:\n\n    ```\n    import React from \'react\';\n\n    function MyComponent() {\n    const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\n    const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature;\n    const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature;\n\n    // ...\n    }\n    ```\nNow you can deploy your component. \n\n4. When you deploy your component to Choreo, create a config file mount at the specified path in each environment (where your index.html expects the config.js file as in this example).\n[https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-a-file-mount-to-your-container](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-a-file-mount-to-your-container).\n', '\n{% include ""create-an-application.md"" %}\n', '\n{% include ""create-an-application.md"" %}\n']","To set up environment variables in **Choreo**, follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Apply Environment Variables**\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component in Choreo Console**:\n   - Go to the **Component Listing** pane and click on the component you want to configure.\n\n2.

How can I deploy my backend and then connect it to the frontend deployed in github pages?,"To deploy your backend and connect it to the frontend deployed in GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Deploy your backend**

To deploy your backend, you need to create a component in Choreo Console. Here's how you can do it:

* Connect your GitHub repository to Choreo by authorizing the Choreo Apps GitHub application to access your account or organization.
* Choose a repository and an associated branch to connect to the Choreo component.
* Select the **Dockerfile** as the **Buildpack** and provide **Dockerfile Path** and **Docker Context Path** for the Docker build.
* Fill in the other fields in the **Create Component** pane, such as **Port** and **OpenAPI Filepath**, if applicable.

**Step 2: Deploy your backend manually**

Once you've created the component, you can deploy it manually by following these steps:

* On the Deploy page, click **Deploy Manually**.
* Choreo will initiate the build pipeline, and upon completion, your application will become accessible in your Development environment through a generated URL.
* You can monitor the progress by observing the console logs on the right of the page.

**Step 3: Connect your backend to your frontend**

To connect your backend to your frontend deployed in GitHub Pages, you need to expose your backend API to the frontend. Here's how you can do it:

* Get the Web App URL of your deployed backend component.
* Use this URL to make API calls from your frontend application.

Please note that the exact steps may vary depending on your specific use case and the technologies you're using.

"I'm getting ""procfile not found"" error for my python service. How do I resolve this?","To resolve the ""procfile not found"" error for your Python service, you need to create a `Procfile` in the project root directory. 

A `Procfile` is a configuration file used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers. In Python projects, it is mandatory to have a `Procfile` with the `web` process type.

Here's an example `Procfile` for a Python application:

```bash
web: <command to start your application>
```

For example:

```bash
web: python main.py
```

or

```bash
web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app
```

or

```bash
web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

Make sure to replace `<command to start your application>` with the actual command to start your Python application.

I'm getting .choreo/endpoints.yaml not found error. How do I resolve this?,"The `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` not found error typically occurs when you're trying to deploy a service component with a buildpack other than `Ballerina` or `WSO2 MI`, and the required `endpoints.yaml` file is missing from the project root directory.

To resolve this issue, you need to create an `endpoints.yaml` file in the `.choreo` directory at the build context path and commit it to the source repository. The file should have a specific structure and contain the required details such as version, name, port, type, network visibility, context, and schema file path.

Here's a sample `endpoints.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
endpoints:
- name: <endpoint_name>
  port: <port_number>
  type: <endpoint_type>
  networkVisibility: <network_visibility>
  context: <context>
  schemaFilePath: <schema_file_path>
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual values for your endpoint.

For example:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
endpoints:
- name: my-rest-api
  port: 8080
  type: REST
  networkVisibility: Public
  context: /my-api
  schemaFilePath: openapi.yaml
```

You can find more information about the `endpoints.yaml` file structure and details in the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file).

Additionally, you can refer to the following documentation for more guidance on configuring endpoints for different buildpacks:

* [Configuring Endpoints for Ballerina Buildpack](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/#configure-endpoints-with-the-ballerina-buildpack)
* [Configuring Endpoints for WSO2 MI Buildpack](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/#configure-endpoints-with-the-wso2-mi-buildpack)

The Choreo GitHub App requires the following permissions:\n- Read access to issues and metadata\n- Read and write access to code, pull requests, and repository hooks\n\nLet's get started!\n"", '\n!!! info\n    This section only applies to Service components.\n\nAfter creating a Service component in Choreo, you have the option to define the endpoints for your service when manually deploying a new image.\n\n1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n2. In the **Build Area** card, click **Update Image & Deploy**. \n3. In the **Endpoint** pane that opens, optionally, you can define the endpoints for your service when you manually deploy the service. \n4. Click  **Create/Update Endpoints**.\n5. Under the **Edit endpoints.yaml** section, you can edit the endpoints YAML file in the provided editor. \n   Alternatively, you can upload the associated API specification/schema files (OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas). Reference this file in the endpoints.yaml file by its file name, instead of the file path. Similar to the Git-based Choreo components. The endpoints template follows the standard definitions for defining endpoints in Choreo. [Learn more](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-service/#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file)\n', ""\nThe method of defining endpoints depends on the buildpack. For buildpacks other than `Ballerina` and `WSO2 MI`, it is required to have an `endpoints.yaml` file in project root directory to create the Service component.\n\n### Configure endpoints with the Ballerina buildpack\n\nWhen you create a service component with the `Ballerina buildpack`, Choreo automatically detects the endpoint details for REST APIs. You can override the auto-generated endpoint configuration by providing the `endpoints.yaml` file in the source directory.\n\n!!! note\n    Automatic endpoint generation is not supported for dynamic endpoint parameters such as variable ports. Therefore, you must use an `endpoint.yaml` file to define dynamic endpoint parameters.\n\nSee [Understanding the endpoints.yaml file](#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file) to learn about the `endpoints.yaml` file.\n\n\n### Configure endpoints with the WSO2 MI buildpack\n\nWSO2 MI buildpack is where you can deploy integrations developed with WSO2 Micro Integrator as an API. In this preset, you have three different ways to define endpoints. Choreo gives priory to the definition of endpoints in the below-mentioned order. \n\n1. **Using endpoints.yaml file**\nThis is the most flexible method to define endpoints. You can configure the endpoint details with the `endpoints.yaml` configuration file. Place this file in the .choreo directory in the project path of the component. \nIf the Micro Integrator project has inbound endpoints, you can expose them via different endpoints using the `endpoints.yaml`\n\n    See [Understanding the endpoints.yaml file](#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file) to learn about the `endpoints.yaml` file.\n\n\n2. **Auto generating endpoints**\nIf `endpoints.yaml` is not provided and if the source Micro Integrator project has APIs, Choreo scans the project and generates the API endpoints. If the project has few APIs, an endpoint will be generated for each API. The visibility of this auto-generated endpoint is set to `Project` by default. You can change the visibility in the deployment flow.\n\n3. **Provide default endpoints**\nIf `endpoints.yaml` is not provided and if the source Micro Integrator project doesn't have APIs, Choreo generates a default endpoint which will expose the default micro integrator port (8290) with `Project` visibility and wildcard context.\n\n### Configure endpoints with the other buildpacks\n\nWhen you build a service component using the other buildpacks(Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, Dockerfile, etc), you can configure the endpoint details with the `endpoints.yaml` configuration file. You must place this file inside the `.choreo` directory at the build context path and commit it to the source repository.\n\nSee [Understanding the endpoints.yaml file](#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file) to learn about the `endpoints.yaml` file.\n\n### Learn the endpoints.yaml file\n\nThe `endpoints.yaml` file has a specific structure and contains the following details:\n\n| Field                | Required     | Description                                                                      |\n|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **version**          | Required     | The version of the `endpoints.yaml` file.                                           |\n| **name**             | Required     | A unique name for the endpoint, which Choreo will use to generate the managed API.|\n| **port**             | Required     | The numeric port value that gets exposed via this endpoint.                      |\n| **type**             | Required     | The type of traffic this endpoint is accepting, such as `REST`, `GraphQL`, `gRPC`, `UDP`or `TCP`. Currently, the MI preset supports only the `REST` type.                                         |\n| **networkVisibility**| Required     | The network level visibility of this endpoint, which defaults to `Project` if not specified. Accepted values are `Project`, `Organization`, or `Public`.|\n| **context**          | Required     | The context (base path) of the API that Choreo exposes via this endpoint.        |\n| **schemaFilePath**   | Required     |  The swagger definition file path. Defaults to the wildcard route if not provided. This field should be a relative path to the project path when using the **Java**, **Python**, **NodeJS**, **Go**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, and **WSO2 MI** buildpacks.

Here is a sample `endpoints.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 0.1\nendpoints:\n- name: Your Service\n port: 9090\n type: REST\n networkVisibility: Project\n context: /your_service\n schemaFilePath: your_service_openapi.yaml\n```\n\nIn this file:\n\n- `name` is a unique name for the endpoint, which Choreo will use to generate the managed API.\n- `port` is the numeric port value that gets exposed via this endpoint.\n- `type` is the type of traffic this endpoint is accepting, such as `REST`, `GraphQL`, `gRPC`, `UDP`or `TCP`.\n- `networkVisibility` is the network level visibility of this endpoint, which defaults to `Public` if not specified. Accepted values are `Project`, `Organization`, or `Public`.\n- `context` is the context (base path) of the API that Choreo exposes via this endpoint. \n- `schemaFilePath` is the swagger definition file path. This field should be a relative path to the project path.\n\nPlease make sure to replace 'Your Service' and '/your_service' with the actual name and context of your service, and 'your_service_openapi.yaml' with the actual OpenAPI schema file.\n\nFor more detailed information about the `endpoints.yaml` file and its structure, you can refer to the following documentation"
Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?,"Configuring a Readiness Probe in Choreo Console
================================================

To ensure that your container is running smoothly and handling traffic efficiently, you can configure a readiness probe. This probe runs periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container and checks whether it is ready to receive traffic. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure a readiness probe in Choreo Console:

**Configuring Readiness Probes**
---------------------------------

To configure a readiness probe:

1. Click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.
2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.
3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.
4. Click **Next** on liveness probe setup. If already liveness setup configured proceed with setup, other go for save then  come to next point  to reach this option if saved recently after done configure in here next create . this prompt due being sequence point under creating when sequence saves save required the add creation menu prompts different ways hence . as thus instead either selecting all simply prompt can press set set these according action types following requirement shown dialog image option exists present

Types of Readiness Probes
-------------------------

There are three types of readiness probes:

*   **HTTP `GET` request**: Sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container.
*   **TCP connection probe**: Attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port.
*   **Execute a command**: Executes a given script inside the container.

Follow the specific documentation of probe based you desire add select enabling , so while based **each screen further differ

How do I connect the service when I don't have authentication for my app?,"To connect a service when you don't have authentication for your app, you can use Choreo's managed authentication. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

**Step 1: Implement the sign-in functionality**

To allow Choreo to manage the sign-in functionality for your web application, you must implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>
```

**Step 2: Obtain user information claims**

Choreo's managed authentication allows you to access user information claims that the identity provider returns post-sign-in, either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource.

**Step 3: Implement the sign-out functionality**

To allow Choreo to manage the sign-out functionality of your web application, you can implement a sign-out button to redirect users to the `/auth/logout` path along with the `session_hint` cookie value on click.

**Step 4: Invoke APIs**

To invoke Choreo APIs within the same organization as your web application, you can use the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, regardless of whether managed authentication is enabled for the web application or not.

For more information, refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services/#create-a-connection-to-a-service).

**Note:** To connect a service when you don't have authentication for your app, you need to create a connection to the service from your web application. To do this, follow the steps given below:

1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu, click the **Project** list, and select the project where you created the web application.
2. On the project home page, click the web application listed under **Component Listing**.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Dependencies** and then click **Connections**.
4. Create a connection to the service you want to connect to.

For more information, refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services/#create-a-connection-to-a-service).","['\nTo secure your web application, you must implement authentication and authorization for it. \n\nTo easily set up authentication for your web application with Choreo\'s managed authentication, follow the steps given below. You can also refer to a sample [React app with managed authentication](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end-with-managed-auth).  \n\n### Step 1.1: Implement the sign-in functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-in functionality for your web application, you must implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n``` javascript\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>\n```\n\nThis code snippet works as follows:\n\nWhen a user clicks sign in on your web application, Choreo will redirect the user to the preconfigured identity provider and handle the authentication process, conforming to the OICD/OAuth2.0 protocols. On successful sign-in, Choreo will set the relevant session cookies and redirect the user to the post-sign-in path (default is `/`). The user can then invoke any Choreo-deployed APIs depending on the permission granted.\n\n### Step 1.2: Obtain user information claims\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication allows you to access user information claims that the identity provider returns post-sign-in, either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource.\n\n\n#### Obtain user information via the `userinfo` cookie\n\nUpon successful sign-in, Choreo\'s managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie that is accessible from the post-sign-in path you configured (by default, set to /). This `userinfo` cookie, provided by the identity provider, contains encoded user information claims.\n\n!!! note\n    - The `userinfo` cookie is intentionally set to have a short lifespan of only 2 minutes.\n    - As a developer, you can decide how to utilize the user information that you retrieve. You must securely store the user information because the stored information can also serve as a means to verify the logged-in state of a user.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0\n\nThe recommended approach is to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie. The following is a sample code snippet that you can include in your post-sign-in path to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie:\n\n``` javascript\n    import Cookies from \'js-cookie\';\n\n    // Read userinfo cookie value.\n    const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get(\'userinfo\')\n\n    // Decode the value. \n    const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\n\n    // Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\n\n    // Clear the cookie.\n    Cookies.remove(\'userinfo\', { path: <post-login-path> })\n```\n#### Obtain user information via a GET endpoint\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication provides the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo` in addition to the `userinfo` cookie that it sets after successful sign-in. You can use this endpoint to query information about users who have signed in. It also serves as a mechanism to check the state of a user who has signed in.\n\nThe following is an example of a request to this endpoint:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(\'/auth/userinfo\')\n```\n\nIf a user has signed in, the server sends a `200 OK` response with the user information in JSON format in the response body. However, if the user is not signed in, the server sends a `401 Unauthorized` response.\n\n### Step 1.3: Implement the sign-out functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-out functionality of your web application, you can implement a sign-out button to redirect users to the `/auth/logout` path along with the `session_hint` cookie value on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n!!! note\n    - It is recommended to clear any user information (if stored) at the time of sign-out.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0  \n    \n``` javascript\n<button onClick={async () => {\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get(\'session_hint\')}`;\n}}>Logout</button>`\n```\n\nWhen a user clicks the sign-out button, Choreo will clear the session cookies and redirect the users to the OIDC logout endpoint of the configured identity provider (if available).\xa0\xa0\n\n### Step 1.4: Invoke APIs\n\nTo invoke Choreo APIs within the same organization as your web application, you can use the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, regardless of whether managed authentication is enabled for the web application or not.\n\n!!! note\n    To invoke a Choreo API from a web application, you need to [create a Connection](../develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services.md#create-a-connection-to-a-service) from the web application to the Choreo API. \n\nFor example, if the API URL is `https://2d9ec1f6-2f04-4127-974f-0a3b20e97af5-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`, the `<api-suffix>` would be `/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`. You can invoke the API using the `/choreo-apis/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0` relative path from your single-page application.\n\n!!! info\n     To copy the exact service URL of a Connection, you can follow the steps given below:\n      1. In the Choreo Console, go to the appropriate web application component.\n      2. In the left navigation menu, click **Connections** under **Dependencies**.\n      3. Click on the required Connection and copy the service URL.\n\nIf you enable Choreo\'s managed authentication, you don\'t have to manually add any logic to attach an access token to the API call because Choreo APIs accept the cookies set by Choreo\'s managed authentication. You can directly invoke the API as follows:\n\n```\n    const response = await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\')\n```\n\nIf Choreo\'s managed authentication is disabled, you must ensure that your web application attaches a valid access token to the API call.\n\n\n### Step 1.5: Refresh session\n\nThe logged is user\'s session expires when the access token provided by the identity provider you have configured expires. After the session expires, the session must be refreshed to successfully call a Choreo-deployed API. For session refresh to function, you must set up the identity provider to issue a refresh token in addition to the access token.\n\n`401 Unauthorized` response status code for a Choreo API request from a logged in user with the necessary permissions indicates a possible session expiry. To refresh the session, you can make a POST request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", { method: ""POST"" })\n```\n\nIf the refresh token is valid, the session will be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `204 No Content` status.\n\nIf the refresh token has expired, the session will not be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status.\n\nTo automate the session refresh process on receiving a `401 unauthorized` response from the Choreo API, you can encapsulate the requests with the refresh logic. The following is an example code snippet that wraps GET requests:\n\n``` javascript\n    export const performGetWithRetry = async (url) => {\n        try {\n            // API call\n            return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n        } catch (error) {\n            if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\n                //Received 401 Unauthorized response from API GW. The access token may have expired.\n\n                // Try to refresh the token\n                const refreshResponse = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", {\n                    method: ""POST""\n                });\n\n                const status = refreshResponse.status;\n                if (status === 401) {\n                    // Session has expired (i.e., Refresh token has also expired).\n                    // Redirect to login page\n                    window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";\n                }\n                if (status !== 204) {\n                    // Tokens cannot be refreshed due to a server error.\n                    console.log(""Failed to refresh token. Status: "" + status);\n\n                    //  Throw the 401 error from API Gateway.\n                    throw error;\n                }\n                // Token refresh successful. Retry the API call.\n                return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n            } else {\n                throw error;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n### Step 1.6: Set up a custom error page\n\nYou can set up Choreo\'s managed authentication to redirect to a customized error page within your web application by defining the error path in the configuration. In the event of an error during a redirection-based process, such as sign in or sign out, Choreo will automatically redirect the user to the designated custom error page.\n\n!!! note\n    If you have not configured an error path, Choreo\'s managed authentication will use its default error page whenever an error occurs.\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication will include the following query parameters in the URL when redirecting to the custom error page:\n\n| Parameter      |  Description                                    |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| code           | A short textual error code indicating the error |\n| message        | The description of the error                    |\n\n\nNow have successfully implemented Choreo\'s managed authentication for your web application. The next step is to enable managed authentication for the component, and subsequently deploy it.\n', '\nBefore you try out this guide, be sure you have the following:\n\n1. An application in the [Choreo Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev). If you do not have an application created, [create a new application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#step-1-create-an-application)\n2. [Generate keys for the application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/create-an-application/#step-2-generate-keys). \n3. [Subscribe APIs to the application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/create-a-subscription/#manage-subscriptions). \n\n', '\nTo enable external IdP authentication for APIs,  create an API on Azure AD that represents the API on Choreo. Follow the steps below: \n\n1. Sign in to the Azure console.\n2. Follow the [Azure guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) to create a Web API that represents your API on Choreo.\n3. In the left navigation menu, under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**.\n4. Add the default **Application ID URI** and click **Save and Continue**.\n5. Under **Scopes defined by this API**, select **Add a scope**.\n6. Enter the fully qualified name as the **scope name**. \n7. Define who can consent. You can alternatively [add a scope requiring admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope-requiring-admin-consent).\n8. Enter appropriate values and click **Add Scope**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: \n\n- [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)\n- [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose a web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)\n\n### Step 2.1: Assign users to the web API\n\nYou can restrict users to the API as follows: \n\n1. Go to your Azure AD main menu. \n2. Under **Manage**,  click on **Enterprise Applications**. Alternatively, on Microsoft Entra, under **Applications**, click **Enterprise Applications**.\n3. Select your API. \n4. Under **Manage**, select the **Users and groups** then select **+ Add user/group**.\n5. Select the users and groups and click **Select**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access](Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access)\n', '\nTo test an API invocation, you must first create a connection to your API. To do this, you must have a web application created. You can use the web application you created while setting up the prerequisites.\n\nTo create a connection to the web application, follow the steps given below:\n\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu, click the **Project** list, and select the project where you created the web application.\n2. On the project home page, click the web application listed under **Component Listing**.\n3. In the left navigation menu, click **Dependencies** and then click **Connections**.\n4. Create a connection to the API you deployed in [Step 1](#step-1-assign-permissions-to-an-api-in-choreo). \n   \nNow you can proceed to deploy the web application.\n\nWhen deploying, if your web application is a single-page application (SPA), you have the option to allow Choreo to handle authentication on behalf of the application. This approach eliminates the need to incorporate OAuth protocol-specific logic into your application.\n\n### Test the invocation when Choreo-managed authentication is enabled\n\nIf managed authentication is enabled for your web application, Choreo automatically handles obtaining the necessary permission for API invocation. This occurs during the request for access tokens, allowing you to seamlessly invoke the subscribed APIs through your web application without additional intervention. \n\n!!! note\n    If you change the permissions of an existing connection or create a new connection with permissions, you must redeploy your web application to ensure proper API invocation with managed authentication.\n\n### Test the invocation when the application manages the authentication\n\nIf your application manages authentication independently, follow the steps below to generate the necessary OAuth credentials to obtain access tokens:\n\n1. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**. This opens the settings of the web application component.\n2. Click the **Authentication Keys** tab.\n3. Click on an environment tab depending on the environment for which you want to generate credentials.\n4. Select **Choreo Built-In Identity Provider** as the identity provider.\n5. Click to expand **Advanced Configurations** and make sure the `code` and `refresh` grant types are selected. This is required to obtain access tokens with an authorization code grant.\n6. Configure the callback URL of the web application to receive the authorization code.\n7. Click **Update Configurations**.\n8. Click **Regenerate Secret** and make a note of the client ID and secret that is generated.\n9. Retrieve an access token using the authorization code grant, specifying the necessary OAuth scopes (You can see the endpoint details on the right side).\n    - When prompted for authentication, enter the credentials of a user within the built-in identity provider (IdP) who possesses the required assigned groups.\n    - Navigate through the OAuth flow to obtain the JWT access token.\n10. Invoke the subscribed API using the access token.', ""\nBefore you try out this guide, ensure you have set up the following:\n\n- Configure the Choreo built-in identity provider with users. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure a User Store with the Built-In Identity Provider](../administer/configure-a-user-store-with-built-in-idp.md).\n- Deploy and publish an API via Choreo. If you don't have an existing API in Choreo, you can either [develop a REST API](../develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-rest-api.md) or an [API Proxy](../develop-components/develop-an-api-proxy.md).\n- A web application for API subscription. If you don't have an application in Choreo, you must [create a web application](../develop-components/develop-a-web-application.md).\n- Administrator rights in your Choreo organization. You need this access to configure role-group and role-permission mappings.\n""]","To connect a service in Choreo without authentication, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add the Connection Configuration**:\n   For single-page applications (SPAs):\n   - **Add the Configuration as a File Mount:**\n     * Navigate to the **Configurations** pane on the **Deploy** page.\n     * Mount a configuration file (e.g., **config.js**) and add the following configuration into it:\n       ```yaml\n       window.configs = {\n         apiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\n       };\n       ```\n   - **Ensure Accessibility via JavaScript:**\n     * Add a script tag in the **index.html** file to reference the **config.js** file:\n       ```html\n       <!DOCTYPE html>\n       <html lang=\en\"">\n       <head>\n         <meta charset=\""utf-8\"" />\n         <title>My React App</title>\n       </head>\n       <body>\n         <div id=\""root\""></div>\n         <script src=\""%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js\""></script>\n       </body>\n       </html>\n       ```\n   For other types of web applications"

How to deploy a webapp?,"To deploy a web application in Choreo, follow these structured steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account with a repository that contains the implementation of your web application.
2. **Sample Repository**: It is recommended to fork the [Choreo sample apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/) to get a reference app.

### Choreo GitHub App Permissions
Ensure that the Choreo GitHub App has the following permissions:
- Read access to issues and metadata.
- Read and write access to code, pull requests, and repository hooks.

### Steps to Deploy Your Web Application
1. **Create a Web Application Component**: In the Choreo console, create a Web Application component and link it to your GitHub repository.
   
2. **Deploy the Component**:
    - On the left menu, click **Deploy**.
    - In the **Build Area** card, click **Deploy Manually**. This initiates the build pipeline, and the deployment may take a few minutes to complete. Choreo manages the automatic TLS/SSL for your app.
    
3. **Monitor Deployment Progress**:
    - You can check the deployment progress by observing the logs on the right side of the page. 
    - The deployment status will change to **Active** once completed.

4. **Deployment Scans**:
    - Choreo performs several scans during deployment:
        - **Dockerfile Scan**: Checks for non-root user ID assignment in the Docker container.
        - **Container Vulnerability Scan (Trivy)**: Detects vulnerabilities in the final docker image.
    - If critical vulnerabilities are found, the build will fail unless you are on a private data plane, where you can ignore these vulnerabilities.

5. **Access Your Web Application**:
    - Once deployed, copy the **Web App URL** provided in the development environment card and paste it into your browser to view your application.

### Additional Information

"How to resolve ""Module not found error"" during the deployment of a Python project?","To resolve a ""Module not found error"" during the deployment of a Python project in Choreo, consider the following general troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the Environment Configuration**:
   - Ensure that all necessary environment variables and configurations are set correctly in your deployment settings. Missing environment variables can lead to module import errors.

2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Make sure that all dependencies (modules/packages) specified in your `requirements.txt` or equivalent dependency file are correctly installed in the environment where you're deploying the project.

3. **Correct Directory Structure**:
   - If your application has a specific directory structure, ensure that the deployed package reflects this structure. Modules should be in the directories where Python expects them to be.

4. **Check Python Version**:
   - Ensure that the version of Python you are using during development matches the version in the deployment environment, as compatibility issues can lead to module errors.

5. **Inspect Logs**:
   - Review the deployment logs for any error messages related to module imports. This can give you clues about what might be going wrong.

6. **Local Testing**:
   - Test the application locally in an environment that closely resembles your deployment environment to catch potential issues before deployment.

These steps should guide you in diagnosing and fixing the ""Module not found error"" during your deployment.

How to add authentication to my service?,"To add authentication to your service using Choreo's managed authentication, you need to follow specific steps to ensure that your web application can securely communicate with your backend service. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to set this up:

### Overview of Steps

1. **Develop and Deploy Your Service Component**: Before implementing authentication, ensure you have a backend service component deployed in Choreo.

2. **Create a Web Application**: Create a web application that will interact with your deployed service.

3. **Configure Authentication**:
   - Use Choreo's managed authentication to handle user sign-in and sign-out.
   - Implement necessary OAuth configurations in your Identity Provider (IdP) if needed.

4. **Invoke the Service Securely**: Ensure that your web application can make authenticated requests to your service.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Develop and Deploy Your Service Component
- Ensure that you have a REST API or service already deployed in Choreo.

#### 2. Create a Web Application
- In the Choreo console, create a web application component. You may refer to the documentation on [creating a web application](../develop-components/develop-a-web-application.md).

#### 3. Enable Managed Authentication
1. **Implement Sign-In Functionality**: 
    - Set up a sign-in button in your web application that redirects users to Choreo’s authentication endpoint.
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={() => { window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>
    ```
   This will redirect users to the identity provider for authentication.

2. **Obtain User Claims**: 
    - After successful authentication, Choreo sets a `userinfo` cookie containing user claims. You can retrieve this information like so:
    ```javascript
    import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

    const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');
    const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));
    Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });
    ```

3. **Implement Sign-Out Functionality**:
    - Create a sign-out button which directs users to the logout path:
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={() => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button>
    ```

4. **Session Management**: 
    - You may need to refresh the session expired situation by calling `/auth/refresh` endpoint when you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

#### 4. Configure Your Identity Provider (IdP)
- If necessary, create an OAuth application in your IdP (like WSO2 Asgardeo) and configure it as follows:
   - Set **Allowed grant types** to Code.
   - Mark the client as a **Public client**.
   - Specify the **Authorized redirect URLs** and **Allowed origins** to match your application.
   - Set **Access Token** to JWT.

#### 5. Deploy Your Web Application
- Once authentication is configured, deploy the web application to ensure that users can access it securely.

### Final Notes
- Ensure that the appropriate permissions and roles are configured in your user store to manage access to the service.
- You can consult the specific documentation on [Choreo managed authentication](../develop-components/develop-a-web-application.md) for more detailed instructions.

By following these steps, you will be able to secure your service with authentication in Choreo and allow users to interact with your application securely. For more details, you can refer to the links provided in the guide.","[""\nChoreo is an Internal Developer Platform (IDevP) that streamlines the entire process of building, deploying, monitoring, and managing your cloud-native applications easily.\n\nIn this quick start guide, you will explore how to expose a service endpoint via Choreo and securely consume the service from a web application. You will use a simple reading list web application with a sign-in page and functionality to interact with a secure backend service. You will also use Choreo's managed authentication to easily set up authentication for your web application without having to dive into the details of security protocols. The application will allow users to sign in and view their reading lists, add books to a reading list, delete books from the reading list, and sign out of the application effortlessly.\n\nThis guide walks you through the following steps:\n\n- Develop, deploy, and test a service component.\n- Create a web application to consume the exposed service.\n- Create a connection to the deployed service.\n- Enable managed authentication and deploy the web application.\n- Consume the deployed service via the web application.\n\n"", '\nTo enable external IdP authentication for APIs,  create an API on Azure AD that represents the API on Choreo. Follow the steps below: \n\n1. Sign in to the Azure console.\n2. Follow the [Azure guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) to create a Web API that represents your API on Choreo.\n3. In the left navigation menu, under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**.\n4. Add the default **Application ID URI** and click **Save and Continue**.\n5. Under **Scopes defined by this API**, select **Add a scope**.\n6. Enter the fully qualified name as the **scope name**. \n7. Define who can consent. You can alternatively [add a scope requiring admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope-requiring-admin-consent).\n8. Enter appropriate values and click **Add Scope**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: \n\n- [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)\n- [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose a web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)\n\n### Step 2.1: Assign users to the web API\n\nYou can restrict users to the API as follows: \n\n1. Go to your Azure AD main menu. \n2. Under **Manage**,  click on **Enterprise Applications**. Alternatively, on Microsoft Entra, under **Applications**, click **Enterprise Applications**.\n3. Select your API. \n4. Under **Manage**, select the **Users and groups** then select **+ Add user/group**.\n5. Select the users and groups and click **Select**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access](Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access)\n', '\nTo secure your web application, you must implement authentication and authorization for it. \n\nTo easily set up authentication for your web application with Choreo\'s managed authentication, follow the steps given below. You can also refer to a sample [React app with managed authentication](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end-with-managed-auth).  \n\n### Step 1.1: Implement the sign-in functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-in functionality for your web application, you must implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n``` javascript\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>\n```\n\nThis code snippet works as follows:\n\nWhen a user clicks sign in on your web application, Choreo will redirect the user to the preconfigured identity provider and handle the authentication process, conforming to the OICD/OAuth2.0 protocols. On successful sign-in, Choreo will set the relevant session cookies and redirect the user to the post-sign-in path (default is `/`). The user can then invoke any Choreo-deployed APIs depending on the permission granted.\n\n### Step 1.2: Obtain user information claims\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication allows you to access user information claims that the identity provider returns post-sign-in, either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource.\n\n\n#### Obtain user information via the `userinfo` cookie\n\nUpon successful sign-in, Choreo\'s managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie that is accessible from the post-sign-in path you configured (by default, set to /). This `userinfo` cookie, provided by the identity provider, contains encoded user information claims.\n\n!!! note\n    - The `userinfo` cookie is intentionally set to have a short lifespan of only 2 minutes.\n    - As a developer, you can decide how to utilize the user information that you retrieve. You must securely store the user information because the stored information can also serve as a means to verify the logged-in state of a user.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0\n\nThe recommended approach is to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie. The following is a sample code snippet that you can include in your post-sign-in path to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie:\n\n``` javascript\n    import Cookies from \'js-cookie\';\n\n    // Read userinfo cookie value.\n    const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get(\'userinfo\')\n\n    // Decode the value. \n    const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\n\n    // Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\n\n    // Clear the cookie.\n    Cookies.remove(\'userinfo\', { path: <post-login-path> })\n```\n#### Obtain user information via a GET endpoint\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication provides the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo` in addition to the `userinfo` cookie that it sets after successful sign-in. You can use this endpoint to query information about users who have signed in. It also serves as a mechanism to check the state of a user who has signed in.\n\nThe following is an example of a request to this endpoint:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(\'/auth/userinfo\')\n```\n\nIf a user has signed in, the server sends a `200 OK` response with the user information in JSON format in the response body. However, if the user is not signed in, the server sends a `401 Unauthorized` response.\n\n### Step 1.3: Implement the sign-out functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-out functionality of your web application, you can implement a sign-out button to redirect users to the `/auth/logout` path along with the `session_hint` cookie value on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n!!! note\n    - It is recommended to clear any user information (if stored) at the time of sign-out.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0  \n    \n``` javascript\n<button onClick={async () => {\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get(\'session_hint\')}`;\n}}>Logout</button>`\n```\n\nWhen a user clicks the sign-out button, Choreo will clear the session cookies and redirect the users to the OIDC logout endpoint of the configured identity provider (if available).\xa0\xa0\n\n### Step 1.4: Invoke APIs\n\nTo invoke Choreo APIs within the same organization as your web application, you can use the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, regardless of whether managed authentication is enabled for the web application or not.\n\n!!! note\n    To invoke a Choreo API from a web application, you need to [create a Connection](../develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services.md#create-a-connection-to-a-service) from the web application to the Choreo API. \n\nFor example, if the API URL is `https://2d9ec1f6-2f04-4127-974f-0a3b20e97af5-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`, the `<api-suffix>` would be `/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`. You can invoke the API using the `/choreo-apis/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0` relative path from your single-page application.\n\n!!! info\n     To copy the exact service URL of a Connection, you can follow the steps given below:\n      1. In the Choreo Console, go to the appropriate web application component.\n      2. In the left navigation menu, click **Connections** under **Dependencies**.\n      3. Click on the required Connection and copy the service URL.\n\nIf you enable Choreo\'s managed authentication, you don\'t have to manually add any logic to attach an access token to the API call because Choreo APIs accept the cookies set by Choreo\'s managed authentication. You can directly invoke the API as follows:\n\n```\n    const response = await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\')\n```\n\nIf Choreo\'s managed authentication is disabled, you must ensure that your web application attaches a valid access token to the API call.\n\n\n### Step 1.5: Refresh session\n\nThe logged is user\'s session expires when the access token provided by the identity provider you have configured expires. After the session expires, the session must be refreshed to successfully call a Choreo-deployed API. For session refresh to function, you must set up the identity provider to issue a refresh token in addition to the access token.\n\n`401 Unauthorized` response status code for a Choreo API request from a logged in user with the necessary permissions indicates a possible session expiry. To refresh the session, you can make a POST request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", { method: ""POST"" })\n```\n\nIf the refresh token is valid, the session will be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `204 No Content` status.\n\nIf the refresh token has expired, the session will not be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status.\n\nTo automate the session refresh process on receiving a `401 unauthorized` response from the Choreo API, you can encapsulate the requests with the refresh logic. The following is an example code snippet that wraps GET requests:\n\n``` javascript\n    export const performGetWithRetry = async (url) => {\n        try {\n            // API call\n            return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n        } catch (error) {\n            if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\n                //Received 401 Unauthorized response from API GW. The access token may have expired.\n\n                // Try to refresh the token\n                const refreshResponse = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", {\n                    method: ""POST""\n                });\n\n                const status = refreshResponse.status;\n                if (status === 401) {\n                    // Session has expired (i.e., Refresh token has also expired).\n                    // Redirect to login page\n                    window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";\n                }\n                if (status !== 204) {\n                    // Tokens cannot be refreshed due to a server error.\n                    console.log(""Failed to refresh token. Status: "" + status);\n\n                    //  Throw the 401 error from API Gateway.\n                    throw error;\n                }\n                // Token refresh successful. Retry the API call.\n                return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n            } else {\n                throw error;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n### Step 1.6: Set up a custom error page\n\nYou can set up Choreo\'s managed authentication to redirect to a customized error page within your web application by defining the error path in the configuration. In the event of an error during a redirection-based process, such as sign in or sign out, Choreo will automatically redirect the user to the designated custom error page.\n\n!!! note\n    If you have not configured an error path, Choreo\'s managed authentication will use its default error page whenever an error occurs.\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication will include the following query parameters in the URL when redirecting to the custom error page:\n\n| Parameter      |  Description                                    |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| code           | A short textual error code indicating the error |\n| message        | The description of the error                    |\n\n\nNow have successfully implemented Choreo\'s managed authentication for your web application. The next step is to enable managed authentication for the component, and subsequently deploy it.\n', '\nYou can invoke the API/service using the credentials you created above. Since Choreo services are secured, you need to invoke the services securely with the help of your IdP. To invoke the API/service you created securely, you need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Create a web application in Choreo.\n2. Create an OAuth application in the IdP. \n3. Configure the web application to authenticate the API/service invocations from the IdP, and securely invoke the service/API in Choreo.\n4. Deploy the web application. \n\nIn this guide, you will be using the following product and examples:\n\n-  WSO2 Asgardeo as the IdP\n- [choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end) as the web application. This is a React SPA that invokes the service using Axios. This web application is configured to read the\n[choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-service](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-service) as the service. You can modify this web application to read your service, or [deploy the choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/quick-start-guides/build-your-first-cloud-native-application-with-choreo/#step-1-create-a-service-component-and-publish-it-as-a-rest-api) in Choreo and use it. \n\n### Step 1: Create a web application component\n\n!!! info\n    You can use your own web application implementation in place of the sample web application. For this exercise, let\'s use the [choreo-samples/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end) as the web application.\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/create-web-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n### Step 2: Create an OAuth application in the IdP\n\nTo invoke the service/API in Choreo you require a token. To obtain a token you need to create an OAuth application in the IdP. If you use any other IdP other than Asgardeo, create an OAuth application and set the following:\n\n-  **Allowed grant types**:  Code\n-  **Public client**: Mark as a public client in an application.\n-  **Authorized redirect URLs**: Enter the web app URL you copied earlier.\n-  **Allowed origins** field: Add the same URLs that you added as authorized redirect URLs.\n-  **Access Token**: Set  JWT as the Token type.\n\nChoreo uses Asgardeo as the default identity provider for Choreo applications. When you create an application in the Choreo Developer Portal, it automatically creates a corresponding application in Asgardeo. You can go to the Asgardeo application to specify the configurations required for end users to sign in to the front-end application. Follow the steps below to configure the Asgardeo OAuth application:\n\n1. Access Asgardeo at [https://console.asgardeo.io/](https://console.asgardeo.io/) and sign in with the same credentials with which you signed in to Choreo.\n2. Make sure you are in the same organization that you were when you created the application in the Choreo Developer Portal. You can click the **Organization** list in the Asgardeo Console top menu and ensure you are in the correct organization.\n3. In the Asgardeo Console\'s left navigation, click **Applications**. You will see the **readingListApp** that Choreo automatically created for you.\n4. Click on the edit icon to edit the application.\n5. Click the **Protocol** tab and apply the following changes:\n\n    1. Under **Allowed grant types**, select **Code**.\n    2. Select the **Public client** checkbox.\n    3. In the **Authorized redirect URLs** field, enter the web app URL you copied earlier and click the **+** icon to add the entry.\n    4. In the **Allowed origins** field, add the same URLs that you added as authorized redirect URLs.\n    5. Under **Access Token**, select **JWT** as the **Token type**.\n    6. Click **Update**.\n\n### Step 3: Configure the web application to connect to the IdP and invoke the service\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/configure-front-end-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n\n### Step 4: Deploy the web application\n\n{% include ""../quick-start-guides/deploy-the-web-application-qsg.md"" %}\n\n\nThat\'s it! You can use a user created in your IdP and invoke the service through your web application.', ""\nBefore you try out this guide, ensure you have set up the following:\n\n- Configure the Choreo built-in identity provider with users. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure a User Store with the Built-In Identity Provider](../administer/configure-a-user-store-with-built-in-idp.md).\n- Deploy and publish an API via Choreo. If you don't have an existing API in Choreo, you can either [develop a REST API](../develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-rest-api.md) or an [API Proxy](../develop-components/develop-an-api-proxy.md).\n- A web application for API subscription. If you don't have an application in Choreo, you must [create a web application](../develop-components/develop-a-web-application.md).\n- Administrator rights in your Choreo organization. You need this access to configure role-group and role-permission mappings.\n""]","To add **authentication** to a service in **Choreo**, you can utilize **Choreo's managed authentication** or configure **custom authentication**. Here are the steps for integrating managed authentication and custom authentication:\n\n**Managed Authentication**\nManaged authentication is a feature provided by **Choreo** that simplifies the process of adding authentication and authorization to your web application. It supports web applications created with **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js** buildpacks.\n\n**Steps to Implement Managed Authentication:**\n\n1. **Implement Sign-in Functionality:**\n```<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = /auth/login"" }}>Login</button>```\nThis redirects users to the **login path** where **Choreo** handles the authentication process.\n\n2. **Obtain User Information Claims:**\n\n**Via Cookie:**\n```import Cookies from 'js-cookie';\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\nCookies.remove('userinfo'"

Alternatively, you can also inject them into the client app during SSR or when serving static content.\n\nHowever, in the case of SPAs that run completely on the browser, Choreo does not support ‘baking-in’ environment variables or other configurations. This is because Choreo follows a multi-environment deployment model, where configuration should be kept separate from the build and injected at runtime. For example, in most React SPA frameworks, the process.env stub is available during build time. However, it does not actually read in variables from the runtime. Instead, it is baked into the final JavaScript output during the build process. \n\nFor managing runtime configurations, Choreo recommends the following approach (this is a React example, but will be generally applicable for other SPA frameworks).\n\n!!! note\n    - With SPAs, anything you mount as a runtime config will be available to your users in the browser. \n    - **Do not include sensitive secrets that are not browser-safe**.\n\n\nFollow the steps below to manage runtime configurations for the React application you created above:\n\n1.

This file should contain any runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your app, such as API endpoints or feature flags. Let\'s expose the API URL and a feature flag as follows:\n\n    ```\n    window.config = {\n    apiUrl: \'https://api.example.com\',\n        featureFlags: {\n            enableNewFeature: true,\n            enableExperimentalFeature: false,\n        },\n    };\n    ```\n2. In your index.html file inside the public directory , add a script tag as follows to include the config.js file inside the <body> tag, so that this config.js file will be accessible via JavaScript at runtime.\n\n    ```\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=""en"">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=""utf-8"" />\n        <title>My React App</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=""root""></div>\n        <script src=""%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js""></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n    ```\nThis will make the `window.config` object available to your app at runtime.\n\n3. In your React component, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object as follows:\n\n    ```\n    import React from \'react\';\n\n    function MyComponent() {\n    const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\n    const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature;\n    const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature;\n\n    // ...\n    }\n    ```\nNow you can deploy your component. \n\n4. When you deploy your component to Choreo, create a config file mount at the specified path in each environment (where your index.html expects the config.js file as in this example).\n[https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-a-file-mount-to-your-container](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-a-file-mount-to-your-container).\n', '\n{% include ""create-an-application.md"" %}\n', '\n{% include ""create-an-application.md"" %}\n']","To set up environment variables in **Choreo**, follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Apply Environment Variables**\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component in Choreo Console**:\n   - Go to the **Component Listing** pane and click on the component you want to configure.\n\n2.

How can I deploy my backend and then connect it to the frontend deployed in github pages?,"To deploy your backend service and connect it to a frontend hosted on GitHub Pages, you can follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Deploy Your Backend Service

1. **Prepare Your GitHub Repository**:
   - Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository with the necessary configuration (e.g., a `Dockerfile` if deploying a containerized application).
   - Optionally, you can fork the [Choreo sample apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/) for reference.

2. **Authorize Choreo GitHub App**:
   - Connect your GitHub account by authorizing the [Choreo Apps](https://github.com/marketplace/choreo-apps) GitHub application. Ensure it has the required permissions:
     - Read access to issues and metadata.
     - Read and write access to code, pull requests, and repository hooks.

3. **Deploy Your Service**:
   - In the Choreo console, navigate to the **Deploy page** and click **Deploy Manually**. This starts the deployment process.
   - Monitor the deployment status and console logs. The system conducts several scans:
     - **Dockerfile scan**: Ensures a non-root user ID.
     - **Container vulnerability scan**: Checks for vulnerabilities in the Docker image.
   - Once the deployment is finished, you will have a generated URL for your service in the Development environment.

4. **Access Your Deployed Service**:
   - Copy the **Web App URL** or the API endpoint generated for your backend service.

### Step 2: Connect Frontend on GitHub Pages

1. **Deploy Your Frontend on GitHub Pages**:
   - Ensure your frontend application (e.g., a React app) is pushed to a repository configured for GitHub Pages.
   - Follow the GitHub Pages guidelines to deploy your frontend.

2. **Connect the Frontend to Your Backend**:
   - Update the API calls in your frontend application to point to the backend service URL generated after deployment.
   - Make sure to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) appropriately in your backend if the frontend and backend are on different origins.

### Step 3: Testing

- After connecting the frontend to the backend, test the entire application by accessing the GitHub Pages URL. Interact with your frontend and ensure it communicates with the backend as expected.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, such as a blank page or a 502 error:
  - Check the output directory specifications and ensure they align with your build output. For instance, if the directory should be `build/` but you specified `public/`, correct it.

This comprehensive workflow involves deploying your backend service on Choreo while ensuring your frontend hosted on GitHub Pages integrates smoothly with it.

How can I implement testing for a full-stack application including automated testing for both frontend and backend components?,"To implement testing for your full-stack application with Choreo, you'll utilize the Test Runner component. Here's a structured approach to setting up automated testing, including both backend and frontend components.

### Step 1: Create a Test Runner Component

1. **Access the Choreo Console**: Start by signing into your Choreo console and navigating to your project home page.

2. **Create a Test Runner**:
   - Click on **+Create** in the **Component Listing** section.
   - Select the **Test Runner** card.
   - Provide a unique name and description for your Test Runner. For instance:
     - **Name**: Your Test Runner Name (e.g., ""Go Test Runner"")
     - **Description**: Test Runner implemented in your chosen language (e.g., ""Test Runner for backend tests"").

3. **Connect to a GitHub Repository**:
   - Click on the **GitHub** tab.
   - Fill in the necessary fields (GitHub Account, Repository, Branch).
   - Choose and set your **Buildpack** according to the programming language (e.g., Go, JavaScript, Python).

#### Example for a Specific Language (Go):
   - **Project Directory**: Set the path for your test scripts (e.g., `/test-runner-go`).
   - **Language Version**: Specify the version you want to use (e.g., `1.x`).

4. **Create the Component**: Click **Create** to finalize the Test Runner setup.

### Step 2: Develop and Run Automated Tests

1. **Clone Your GitHub Repository**: 
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository_url>` with your actual repository URL.

2. **Editing Test Files**:
   - Open the cloned repository in your development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
   - Write your test cases using the specified language. The tests can assess both frontend and backend behavior.

3. **Save and Commit Changes**:
   - After editing your test scripts, save changes.
   - Use the following Git commands to commit and push your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m ""Implement test cases""
     git push
     ```

### Step 3: Execute the Tests

- Once your Test Runner is set up with test scripts pushed to your GitHub repository, you can run the tests directly through the Choreo Console.

### Additional Notes
- Choreo allows you to implement tests using popular programming languages such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- You can also create advanced testing scenarios by supplying a Dockerfile with custom test scripts or using Postman collections.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the Choreo documentation regarding the creation and management of Test Runner components: [Choreo Console](https://console.choreo.dev/)

"I'm getting ""procfile not found"" error for my python service. How do I resolve this?","The ""Procfile not found"" error indicates that your Python service is missing a `Procfile`, which is mandatory for Python projects in Choreo. The `Procfile` is used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers, and it must be located in the root directory of your project.

To resolve this issue, you need to create a `Procfile` in the root directory of your service component with the necessary configuration. Here’s how you can do that:

### Steps to Create a Procfile

1. **Create the Procfile:**
   - In the root directory of your Python project, create a new file named `Procfile` (make sure there's no file extension).

2. **Define the Web Process:**
   - Open the `Procfile` and add the following line to define how to start your application:
     ```
     web: python main.py
     ```
   - You can replace `python main.py` with the appropriate command to start your application, such as:
     ```
     web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app
     ```
   - Or if you are using Flask:
     ```
     web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
     ```

### Example Procfile
Here's an example of what your `Procfile` might look like:

```
web: python main.py
```

### Validation
Make sure your `Procfile` is correctly named (case-sensitive) and located in the root of your project. After creating it, you can try deploying your service again.

For more information and examples, you can refer to the Choreo documentation: [Choreo Samples](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples).

After following these steps, the error should be resolved, and your service should be able to start correctly.","['\nTo develop a service component that exposes a REST API in Go. you can follow the [Develop a Go REST API ](develop-services/develop-a-go-rest-api.md) guide.\n\nFollow the guidelines below based on your language:\n\n=== ""Python""\n    Supported Versions - 3.10.x, 3.11.x\n\n    Refer below examples for different component types.

A `Procfile` is a configuration file used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers. \n\nFor a Python project, your `Procfile` might look something like this:\n```\nweb: <command to start your application>\n``` \nFor example, if you're using Flask, your `Procfile` should look like this:\n```\nweb: flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n```\n\nPlease ensure that you have a `Procfile` in your project root directory and that it contains the appropriate command to start your application.

I'm getting .choreo/endpoints.yaml not found error. How do I resolve this?,"The error message `.choreo/endpoints.yaml not found` suggests that your service component is missing the required `endpoints.yaml` file within the `.choreo` directory in your project structure. This file is crucial for defining the endpoints for your service within Choreo, especially for specific buildpacks.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### Steps to Resolve the Error

1. **Verify File Location**:
   Ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is located in the correct directory. For a service component, the file should be placed in the `.choreo` directory at the root of your project. The expected file path is:
   ```
   <project-root>/.choreo/endpoints.yaml
   ```

2. **Create the `endpoints.yaml` File**:
   If the file does not exist, you will need to create it. Below is a sample structure of what the `endpoints.yaml` file should contain:

   ```yaml
   version: '1.0.0'
   name: your-endpoint-name
   port: 8080
   type: REST
   networkVisibility: Project
   context: /your-api-context
   schemaFilePath: path/to/your/openapi.yaml
   ```

   Make sure to replace values such as `your-endpoint-name`, `port`, `context`, and `schemaFilePath` with your actual configuration details.

3. **Check for Buildpack Requirements**:
   Depending on the buildpack you are using (e.g., Ballerina, WSO2 MI, or others), the requirements for the `endpoints.yaml` file might vary. For example:
   - For Ballerina buildpack: Choreo can auto-generate endpoints, but to define dynamic parameters, you still need an `endpoints.yaml`.
   - For WSO2 MI buildpack: Ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is in your `.choreo` directory, as this is the recommended method for defining endpoints.

4. **Commit Changes**:
   If you are working with a GitHub repository, ensure that you commit your changes to the repository after creating or updating the `endpoints.yaml` file.

### Additional Considerations
- If you are working with components that were built using other buildpacks (like Java, Python, etc.), they also require the `endpoints.yaml` file for proper configuration.
- Always ensure that your `endpoints.yaml` conforms to the expected structure, as any discrepancies may lead to deployment failures.

If you follow these guidelines and ensure that your `endpoints.yaml` file is correctly placed and structured, you should be able to resolve the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml not found` error.

For further details on how to configure the `endpoints.yaml` file, you can check the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-service/#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file).","[""\n1. To deploy a service component with a GraphQL endpoint, you will need a GitHub account with a repository that contains an `endpoints.yaml`. Fork the [Choreo sample apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/), which contains the sample for this guide.\n2. The Choreo GitHub App requires the following permissions:\n- Read access to issues and metadata\n- Read and write access to code, pull requests, and repository hooks\n\nLet's get started!\n"", '\n!!! info\n    This section only applies to Service components.\n\nAfter creating a Service component in Choreo, you have the option to define the endpoints for your service when manually deploying a new image.\n\n1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n2. In the **Build Area** card, click **Update Image & Deploy**. \n3. In the **Endpoint** pane that opens, optionally, you can define the endpoints for your service when you manually deploy the service. \n4. Click  **Create/Update Endpoints**.\n5. Under the **Edit endpoints.yaml** section, you can edit the endpoints YAML file in the provided editor. \n   Alternatively, you can upload the associated API specification/schema files (OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas). Reference this file in the endpoints.yaml file by its file name, instead of the file path. Similar to the Git-based Choreo components. The endpoints template follows the standard definitions for defining endpoints in Choreo. [Learn more](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-service/#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file)\n', ""\nThe method of defining endpoints depends on the buildpack. For buildpacks other than `Ballerina` and `WSO2 MI`, it is required to have an `endpoints.yaml` file in project root directory to create the Service component.\n\n### Configure endpoints with the Ballerina buildpack\n\nWhen you create a service component with the `Ballerina buildpack`, Choreo automatically detects the endpoint details for REST APIs. You can override the auto-generated endpoint configuration by providing the `endpoints.yaml` file in the source directory.\n\n!!! note\n    Automatic endpoint generation is not supported for dynamic endpoint parameters such as variable ports. Therefore, you must use an `endpoint.yaml` file to define dynamic endpoint parameters.\n\nSee [Understanding the endpoints.yaml file](#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file) to learn about the `endpoints.yaml` file.\n\n\n### Configure endpoints with the WSO2 MI buildpack\n\nWSO2 MI buildpack is where you can deploy integrations developed with WSO2 Micro Integrator as an API. In this preset, you have three different ways to define endpoints. Choreo gives priory to the definition of endpoints in the below-mentioned order. \n\n1. **Using endpoints.yaml file**\nThis is the most flexible method to define endpoints. You can configure the endpoint details with the `endpoints.yaml` configuration file. Place this file in the .choreo directory in the project path of the component. \nIf the Micro Integrator project has inbound endpoints, you can expose them via different endpoints using the `endpoints.yaml`\n\n    See [Understanding the endpoints.yaml file](#learn-the-endpointsyaml-file) to learn about the `endpoints.yaml` file.\n\n\n2. **Auto generating endpoints**\nIf `endpoints.yaml` is not provided and if the source Micro Integrator project has APIs, Choreo scans the project and generates the API endpoints. If the project has few APIs, an endpoint will be generated for each API. The visibility of this auto-generated endpoint is set to `Project` by default. You can change the visibility in the deployment flow.\n\n3. **Provide default endpoints**\nIf `endpoints.yaml` is not provided and if the source Micro Integrator project doesn't have APIs, Choreo generates a default endpoint which will expose the default micro integrator port (8290) with `Project` visibility and wildcard context.\n\n### Configure endpoints with the other buildpacks\n\nWhen you build a service component using the other buildpacks(Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, Dockerfile, etc), you can configure the endpoint details with the `endpoints.yaml` configuration file.

Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?,"To configure readiness and liveness probes for your container in Choreo, follow these steps:

### Steps to Configure Probes

1. **Open the Component**
   - Navigate to your component in the **Component Listing** pane of the Choreo Console.

2. **Access Health Checks**
   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps**, then select **Health Checks**.

3. **Create Probes**
   - On the **Health Checks** page, click on **+ Create**.

4. **Configure Liveness Probe**
   - Set up the liveness probe according to your requirements. You can choose from different types of probes:
     - **HTTP GET Request**: Sends an HTTP GET request to a specified port and path. A successful response code (200-399) indicates the probe is successful.
     - **TCP Connection Probe**: Attempts to establish a TCP connection to the container on a specified port. A failure to connect is considered a probe failure.
     - **Execute a Command**: Runs a specific command inside the container. A non-zero return code indicates a failure.
   - It is recommended to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint for more reliable HTTP checks.

5. **Save Liveness Probe**
   - After configuring the liveness probe, click **Save**.

6. **Configure Readiness Probe**
   - Next, configure the readiness probe following similar criteria based on your application needs.

7. **Save Readiness Probe**
   - Click **Save** to apply the settings for the readiness probe.

### Important Notes
- Readiness probes are crucial for managing traffic to your application. If a readiness probe fails, it stops the application from receiving traffic until it recovers, which is particularly important to consider for single replicas.
- Liveness probes help your application restart automatically in case of a crash or unresponsive state.

### Verifying the Configuration
To ensure that your container works as expected after configuring the probes:

1. In the left navigation menu, click on **Runtime** under **DevOps**.
2. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container is functioning correctly. If it fails to start, review the events and conditions to see if any of the probes are causing the issue.

How do I connect the service when I don't have authentication for my app?,"To connect your app to a service without having your own authentication implemented, you can leverage Choreo's managed authentication. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Steps to Connect Without Custom Authentication:

1. **Set Up Managed Authentication:**
   - Implement the sign-in functionality in your web application. Add a button that redirects users to the Choreo authentication URL (i.e., `/auth/login`).

   ```javascript
   <button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>
   ```

2. **Obtain User Information:**
   - After successful authentication, Choreo sets a `userinfo` cookie. You can access this user information from your post-sign-in path.

   ```javascript
   import Cookies from 'js-cookie';
   const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');
   const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));
   Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });
   ```

   Alternatively, you can also request user information from the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint.

   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');
   ```

3. **Invoke APIs:**
   - To invoke Choreo APIs, you can use a relative path starting with `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`. Managed authentication will automatically attach the necessary cookies for authentication.

   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');
   ```

4. **Handle Session Refresh:**
   - Set up a refresh mechanism to ensure that tokens are renewed. You can implement a post request to `/auth/refresh` to refresh the session if you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response indicating that the session has expired.

   ```javascript
   const refreshResponse = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", { method: ""POST"" });
   ```

5. **Customize Error Handling:**
   - If needed, you can set a custom error page within your web app for authentication-related errors by configuring an error path.

### Notes:
- Ensure that your web application is created and deployed in the Choreo console beforehand.
- Make sure you have configured necessary API subscriptions for your app to utilize the services.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly connect your application to Choreo-managed services without needing to implement your own authentication solutions. 

For further detailed steps, you can refer to the documentation: [Managed Authentication Implementation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#step-1-create-an-application).","['\nTo secure your web application, you must implement authentication and authorization for it. \n\nTo easily set up authentication for your web application with Choreo\'s managed authentication, follow the steps given below. You can also refer to a sample [React app with managed authentication](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-list-app/reading-list-front-end-with-managed-auth).  \n\n### Step 1.1: Implement the sign-in functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-in functionality for your web application, you must implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n``` javascript\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>\n```\n\nThis code snippet works as follows:\n\nWhen a user clicks sign in on your web application, Choreo will redirect the user to the preconfigured identity provider and handle the authentication process, conforming to the OICD/OAuth2.0 protocols. On successful sign-in, Choreo will set the relevant session cookies and redirect the user to the post-sign-in path (default is `/`). The user can then invoke any Choreo-deployed APIs depending on the permission granted.\n\n### Step 1.2: Obtain user information claims\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication allows you to access user information claims that the identity provider returns post-sign-in, either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource.\n\n\n#### Obtain user information via the `userinfo` cookie\n\nUpon successful sign-in, Choreo\'s managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie that is accessible from the post-sign-in path you configured (by default, set to /). This `userinfo` cookie, provided by the identity provider, contains encoded user information claims.\n\n!!! note\n    - The `userinfo` cookie is intentionally set to have a short lifespan of only 2 minutes.\n    - As a developer, you can decide how to utilize the user information that you retrieve. You must securely store the user information because the stored information can also serve as a means to verify the logged-in state of a user.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0\n\nThe recommended approach is to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie. The following is a sample code snippet that you can include in your post-sign-in path to retrieve user information from the cookie and subsequently clear the cookie:\n\n``` javascript\n    import Cookies from \'js-cookie\';\n\n    // Read userinfo cookie value.\n    const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get(\'userinfo\')\n\n    // Decode the value. \n    const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\n\n    // Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\n\n    // Clear the cookie.\n    Cookies.remove(\'userinfo\', { path: <post-login-path> })\n```\n#### Obtain user information via a GET endpoint\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication provides the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo` in addition to the `userinfo` cookie that it sets after successful sign-in. You can use this endpoint to query information about users who have signed in. It also serves as a mechanism to check the state of a user who has signed in.\n\nThe following is an example of a request to this endpoint:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(\'/auth/userinfo\')\n```\n\nIf a user has signed in, the server sends a `200 OK` response with the user information in JSON format in the response body. However, if the user is not signed in, the server sends a `401 Unauthorized` response.\n\n### Step 1.3: Implement the sign-out functionality\n\nTo allow Choreo to manage the sign-out functionality of your web application, you can implement a sign-out button to redirect users to the `/auth/logout` path along with the `session_hint` cookie value on click. You can use the following code snippet or any custom button component from a preferred UI component library:\n\n!!! note\n    - It is recommended to clear any user information (if stored) at the time of sign-out.\n    - The following example uses the `js-cookie` library for cookie parsing. You can use any cookie-parsing library of your choice.\xa0  \n    \n``` javascript\n<button onClick={async () => {\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get(\'session_hint\')}`;\n}}>Logout</button>`\n```\n\nWhen a user clicks the sign-out button, Choreo will clear the session cookies and redirect the users to the OIDC logout endpoint of the configured identity provider (if available).\xa0\xa0\n\n### Step 1.4: Invoke APIs\n\nTo invoke Choreo APIs within the same organization as your web application, you can use the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, regardless of whether managed authentication is enabled for the web application or not.\n\n!!! note\n    To invoke a Choreo API from a web application, you need to [create a Connection](../develop-components/sharing-and-reusing-services.md#create-a-connection-to-a-service) from the web application to the Choreo API. \n\nFor example, if the API URL is `https://2d9ec1f6-2f04-4127-974f-0a3b20e97af5-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`, the `<api-suffix>` would be `/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0`. You can invoke the API using the `/choreo-apis/rbln/item-service/api-e04/1.0.0` relative path from your single-page application.\n\n!!! info\n     To copy the exact service URL of a Connection, you can follow the steps given below:\n      1. In the Choreo Console, go to the appropriate web application component.\n      2. In the left navigation menu, click **Connections** under **Dependencies**.\n      3. Click on the required Connection and copy the service URL.\n\nIf you enable Choreo\'s managed authentication, you don\'t have to manually add any logic to attach an access token to the API call because Choreo APIs accept the cookies set by Choreo\'s managed authentication. You can directly invoke the API as follows:\n\n```\n    const response = await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\')\n```\n\nIf Choreo\'s managed authentication is disabled, you must ensure that your web application attaches a valid access token to the API call.\n\n\n### Step 1.5: Refresh session\n\nThe logged is user\'s session expires when the access token provided by the identity provider you have configured expires. After the session expires, the session must be refreshed to successfully call a Choreo-deployed API. For session refresh to function, you must set up the identity provider to issue a refresh token in addition to the access token.\n\n`401 Unauthorized` response status code for a Choreo API request from a logged in user with the necessary permissions indicates a possible session expiry. To refresh the session, you can make a POST request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nconst response = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", { method: ""POST"" })\n```\n\nIf the refresh token is valid, the session will be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `204 No Content` status.\n\nIf the refresh token has expired, the session will not be refreshed, and the system will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status.\n\nTo automate the session refresh process on receiving a `401 unauthorized` response from the Choreo API, you can encapsulate the requests with the refresh logic. The following is an example code snippet that wraps GET requests:\n\n``` javascript\n    export const performGetWithRetry = async (url) => {\n        try {\n            // API call\n            return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n        } catch (error) {\n            if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\n                //Received 401 Unauthorized response from API GW. The access token may have expired.\n\n                // Try to refresh the token\n                const refreshResponse = await fetch(""/auth/refresh"", {\n                    method: ""POST""\n                });\n\n                const status = refreshResponse.status;\n                if (status === 401) {\n                    // Session has expired (i.e., Refresh token has also expired).\n                    // Redirect to login page\n                    window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";\n                }\n                if (status !== 204) {\n                    // Tokens cannot be refreshed due to a server error.\n                    console.log(""Failed to refresh token. Status: "" + status);\n\n                    //  Throw the 401 error from API Gateway.\n                    throw error;\n                }\n                // Token refresh successful. Retry the API call.\n                return await fetch(\'/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>\');\n            } else {\n                throw error;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n### Step 1.6: Set up a custom error page\n\nYou can set up Choreo\'s managed authentication to redirect to a customized error page within your web application by defining the error path in the configuration. In the event of an error during a redirection-based process, such as sign in or sign out, Choreo will automatically redirect the user to the designated custom error page.\n\n!!! note\n    If you have not configured an error path, Choreo\'s managed authentication will use its default error page whenever an error occurs.\n\nChoreo\'s managed authentication will include the following query parameters in the URL when redirecting to the custom error page:\n\n| Parameter      |  Description                                    |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| code           | A short textual error code indicating the error |\n| message        | The description of the error                    |\n\n\nNow have successfully implemented Choreo\'s managed authentication for your web application. The next step is to enable managed authentication for the component, and subsequently deploy it.\n', '\nBefore you try out this guide, be sure you have the following:\n\n1.

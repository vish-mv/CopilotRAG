# Billing for Platform Services (Databases and Caches)

Any platform services you create within your Choreo Organization will be included in your current Choreo subscription. The quantity included will vary depending on the service plan of the resources you create.

A few important considerations: 

- Usage is billed hourly. If you create a database that you later remove within the same month, you will only be charged for the hours during which it was active.
- Fixed pricing based on service plans. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwidth usage.


!!!Tip "Try out the free trial"
    Choreo provides a 7 day free trial for all database types on the 'Hobbyist' service plan (for free tier users).

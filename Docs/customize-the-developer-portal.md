# Customize the Developer Portal

The Developer Portal allows API consumers to find and consume APIs with ease. You can change the look and feel of your Developer Portal by changing the theme to match your brand. Doing so will help you give a better developer experience to your users.

To customize the Developer Portal theme, follow the steps given below:

!!! Note
    - To customize the Developer Portal theme for an organization, you need to be an admin user of that organization.
    - You cannot undo a change and restore or revert to a previous version of the theme. However, you can reset it to the default theme.

1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/) using a Google/ GitHub/ Microsoft account.


2. In the left pane, click **Settings**.

4. In the header, click the **Organization** list. This will open the organization level settings page. 

5. In the **API Management** tab, click **Devportal Theme**.

    Once you access the theme, you can customize the **Home** page, color theme, font, header and footer, logos, etc., by expanding the relevant sections.

6. Make a change to the theme. For example, let's change the title on the **Home** page and the color theme. 

    1. To update the title on the **Home** page, expand the **Home Page** section, and in the **Title** field, change the default text (for example, to `Try our APIs!`).
   
    2. To update the color theme, expand the **Color Palette** section, and change the colors as required (for example, change the background color to `#C3C5CD` and the primary color of the buttons to `#086634`).
   
    3. Click **Preview** to view a preview of the Developer Portal with the changes you made. Based on the changes given in the examples, the preview appears as follows.

    4. Click **Save** to save your changes as a draft theme.
    
    5. To apply the changes to the Developer Portal, toggle the **Go Live** switch. To confirm that you want to go live with the changes, click **Enable** in the message that appears.

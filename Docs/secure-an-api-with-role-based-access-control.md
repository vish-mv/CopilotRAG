# Secure an API with Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control is a flexible and scalable approach to manage access to API resources. In this approach, each user or group is assigned a specific role that determines the permission granted to perform operations on an API resource.

This tutorial explains how to implement role-based access control using Choreo and Asgardeo. It includes a real-world scenario with instructions to create and publish an API proxy component in Choreo and apply role-based access control.

## Scenario

An organization needs to implement a user management service to keep track of users. The service needs to perform the following four operations:

  - List existing users
  - List a user
  - Create new users
  - Delete a user

There are two types of users in the organization:

  - Human Resource Manager (HR manager)
  - Human Resource Officer (HR officer)

Each user type requires different levels of access to the user management service.

  - The HR manager must have permission to perform the following operations: list existing users, list a user, create new users, and delete a user.
  - The HR officer must have permission to perform the following operations: list existing users and list a user.

## Implement role-based access control with Choreo and Asgardeo

Letâ€™s take a look at the steps to follow to implement the scenario described above using Choreo and Asgardeo.

### Prerequisites

Before you try out this guide, complete the following:

If you are signing in to the Choreo Console for the first time, create an organization as follows:

 1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/), and sign in using your preferred method.
 2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
 3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
 4. Click **Create**.

This creates the organization and opens the home page of the default project created for you.

!!! info "Enable Asgardeo as the key manager"
         
     If you created your organization in Choreo before the 21st of February 2023, and you have not already enabled Asgardeo as the key manager, follow these steps to enable Asgardeo as the default key manager:

      1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu and click **Organization**. This takes you to the organization's home page.
      2. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.
      3. In the header, click the **Organization** list. This will open the organization level settings page. 
      4. Click the **API Management** tab and then click **Enable Asgardeo Key Manager**.
      5. In the confirmation dialog that opens, click **Yes**.

        !!!tip

            Enabling Asgardeo as the default key manager has the following effects:

             - Once the Asgardeo Key Manager is enabled, it will act as the default key manager. You cannot disable, change, or remove it.
             - Existing applications created via the Developer Portal in your organization will continue to function as usual. However, any new application you create within the organization will use Asgardeo as the key manager.
             - New grant types such as **Password**, **Authorization Code**, **PKCE**, and **Implicit**, which were not available in Choreo will become available.
             - The capability to add an external IdP will be disabled because Asgardeo does not support token exchange. However, you can use the [federation capabilities of Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/get-started/asgardeo-use-cases/#identity-federation) to achieve similar functionality.


### Step 1: Create an API proxy component and deploy it

Follow these steps to create an API proxy component, add resources, and deploy it:

1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/cloud-native-app-developer) and sign in. This opens the project home page.
2. To create an API proxy component, follow the instructions in [Develop an API Proxy: Step 1](../develop-components/develop-an-api-proxy.md#step-1-create-an-api-proxy). This opens the **Resources** pane, where you can define resources for the API proxy.
3. In the **Resources** pane, follow the steps given below to add resources:

     - Select **GET** as the **HTTP Verb**, enter `/users` as the **URI Pattern**, and click **+** to add the resource.
     - Select **GET** as the **HTTP Verb**, enter `/users/{userID}` as the **URI Pattern**, and click **+** to add the resource.
     - Select **POST** as the **HTTP Verb**, enter `/users` as the **URI Pattern**, and click **+** to add the resource.
     - Select **DELETE** as the **HTTP Verb**, enter `/users/{userID}` as the **URI Pattern**, and click **+** to add the resource.
     
4. To remove the five default resources that start with `/*`, click the delete icon corresponding to each resource. This marks the resources for deletion.
5. Click **Save**. The API resources will be as follows:

    ![API resources](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/api-resources.png)

6. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
7. Go to the **Build Area** card and click **Configure & Deploy**. The **Configure & Deploy** pane opens with the endpoint populated as `https://samples.choreoapps.dev/company/hr`.
8. Click **Save & Deploy**.

### Step 2: Apply permission to resources and publish the API

Follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Manage**, and then click **Permissions**. 
2. In the **Permissions** pane, click **+ Add Permission(Scope)**.
3. To add necessary permission values to the permission list, follow the steps given below:
    1. In the **Permission List** pane, enter `get_user_list` as the permission value and click **+Add New**.
    2. Similarly, add `get_user`, `create_user`, and `delete_user` as permission values.
4. In the **Permissions** pane, select the permission values as follows for each of the resources:

    |  **Resource**             | **Permission** |
    |---------------------------|----------------|
    | **GET/users**             | `get_user_list`|
    | **GET/users/{userID}**    | `get_user`     |
    | **POST/users**            | `create_user`  |
    | **DELETE/users/{userID}** | `delete_user`  |

5. Click **Save and Deploy**.
  
    !!!note

            To verify whether the permission(scope) values have been applied to the resources, click **Settings**, then click the **Resources** tab, expand a resource, and check the attached permission value.

            ![Resource permission](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/resource-permission.png){.cInlineImage-full}

Now you are ready to promote the API to production.

6. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
7. Go to the **Development** card and click **Promote**. The **Configure & Deploy** pane opens with the **Use Development endpoint configuration** option selected by default.
8. Click **Next** to promote the API to production. Now you can publish the API
9. In the left navigation menu, click **Manage** and then click **Lifecycle**.
10. In the **Lifecycle Management** pane, click **Publish**.
    A message will appear giving you the option to publish a connector for this REST API proxy. By creating a connector, you can make the API available in the Marketplace. In this tutorial, you will not publish a connector for the API.
11. Click **No, Thanks**. This changes the status of the API to **Published**.

Now, an application developer can discover the API, subscribe to it and then invoke it.

### Step 3: Subscribe to the Published API

In this step, you take the role of an application developer who consumes the published API.
To consume the API, you must create an application, generate keys, and subscribe to the API.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [API Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev/) and click **Applications** on the top menu.
2. Click **+Create**.
3. Enter `User Management App` as the **Application Name** and click **Create**. This creates the application and takes you to the application overview page.
4. In the Developer Portal left navigation menu, click **Production** under **Credentials**.
5. Click to expand **Advanced Configurations** and follow these steps to generate credentials for the application:
    1. Select **Code** as the grant type.
    2. Enter the hosted URL of the application as the **Callback URL**.
    3. Click **Generate Credentials**.
6. To subscribe to the API follow these steps:
    1. In the Developer Portal left navigation menu, click **Subscriptions**.
    2. In the **Subscription Management** pane, click **Add APIs**.
    3. In the **Add APIs** list, go to the API you created, and click **Add**.

### Step 4: Define roles and assign them to groups

In this step, you define roles, create necessary groups and assign appropriate roles to groups so that you can easily manage user permission.

Follow these steps:

1. In the Developer Portal left navigation menu, click **Production** under **Credentials**.
2. In the **Permissions** section, click **Manage Permissions**. This takes you to the **Roles** tab of the  `User Management App` application in Asgardeo, where you can add applicable roles.

    ![Manage permissions](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/manage-permission.png)

3. Follow these steps to add roles:
    1. Click **+ New Role**,  enter `admin` as the **Role Name**, and click **Next**.
    2. Select `get_user_list`, `get_user`, `create_user`, and `delete_user`as **Role Permissions**.
    3. Click **Finish**.
    4. Similarly, add another role with `user` as the **Role Name** and `get_user_list`, and `get_user` as **Role Permissions**.
    
    Now you can proceed to create groups and assign applicable roles to the groups.
    
4. In the Asgardeo Console left navigation menu, click **Groups**.
5. In the **Groups** pane, follow these steps to add groups and assign roles:
    1. Click **+ New Group**,  enter `HR-Manager` as the **Group Name**, and click **Finish**.
    2. Click the **Roles** tab in the HR-Manager group you created and then click **+ Assign Roles**. 
    3. Click the arrow corresponding to the User Management App to view applicable roles and select **admin**.
    4. Click **Save**.
    5. Similarly, add another group with `HR-Officer` as the **Group Name** and assign the **user** role to it.


### Step 5: Define users and assign them to groups

In this step, you define users and assign them to groups depending on the job function of the user. This allows you to manage permission at the group level instead of for individual users.

Follow these steps:

1. Define two users named `Cameron` and `Alex`.  For step-by-step instructions on adding a user, see [Manage users](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/users/manage-customers/#onboard-a-user) in the Asgardeo documentation.
2. Assign `Cameron` to the **HR-Manager** group and assign `Alex` to the **HR-Officer** group. For step-by-step instructions on assigning a user to a group, see [Assign groups](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/users/manage-customers/#assign-groups) in the Asgardeo documentation.

### Step 6: Obtain an access token and try out the API

Follow these steps:

1. Construct the authorization URL as follows by replacing the placeholders with appropriate values:

     ```
     <authorize_URL>?response_type=code&client_id=<clientID>&redirect_uri=<redirect_URL>&scope=<scopes>
     ```

    - Replace `<authorize URL>` with the URL populated as the **Authorize Endpoint** in the **Application Keys** pane.

        ![Authorize endpoint](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/authorize-endpoint.png){.cInlineImage-full}

    - Replace `<redirect_URL>` with the value specified as the **Callback URL** under **Advanced Configurations** in the **Application Keys** pane.

        ![Callback URL](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/callback-url.png){.cInlineImage-full}

     - Replace `<scopes>` with the permission(scopes) applicable to the user. You can copy the applicable permission(scopes) from the **API Overview** page. Here letâ€™s copy the permission(scopes) applicable to the user `Alex`.

        ![Scopes](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/scopes.png){.cInlineImage-full}

     - Replace `<clientID>` with the value populated as **Consumer Key** in the **Application Keys** pane.

        ![Consumer key](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/consumer-key.png){.cInlineImage-full}

2. Open the constructed URL via a web browser. This will take you to a sign-in page provided by Asgardeo.

3. Sign in with credentials of `Alex` and click **Allow** to approve the consent.

      ![Approve consent](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/consent.png){.cInlineImage-small}

    This redirects you to the callback URL of the application. The URL includes a code as a query parameter.

       ![Code](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/code.png){.cInlineImage-half}

4. Copy the code and use it to replace `<code>` in the following cURL command to invoke the authorization code grant token request:

     ```
     curl <token_url> -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=<code>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>" -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(clientId:clientSecret)>"
     ```

    - Replace `<token_url>` with the URL populated as the **Token Endpoint** in the **Application Keys** pane.

           ![Token endpoint](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/token-endpoint.png){.cInlineImage-full}

    - Replace `<redirect_uri>` with the value specified as the **Callback URL** under **Advanced Configurations** in the **Application Keys** pane.
    
    - Use a Base64 encoder to encode your client ID and client secret in the following format and replace `<base64(clientId:clientSecret)>` with the encoded value:

        **`<clientId>:<clientSecret>`**
  
        !!!note

                WSO2 does not recommend the use of online Base64 encoders for this purpose.

5. Extract the access token from the response that you get.

      ![Access token](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/access-token.png){.cInlineImage-full}

6. Go to the [API Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev/), try out the HR API using the access token you extracted, and observe the responses.

    Youâ€™ll observe that it is only possible to access the following resources because the access token only contains the permission(scopes) to invoke those resources:

    - GET /users
    - GET /users/{userID}

    Invoking any other resource gives you a scope validation failed response because the token doesn't include the required scopes to invoke them.
       ![Scope validation failed](../assets/img/tutorials/role-based-auth/scope-validation-failed.png){.cInlineImage-full}    

   Similarly, if you use Cameronâ€™s credentials and sign in to obtain an access token, you'll observe that you can invoke all four resources because it would contain all the required permission(scopes).

Now you have gained hands-on experience in implementing role-based access control with Choreo and Asgardeo.

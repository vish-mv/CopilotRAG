- **Error Request Count**

  ![Error request count](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/overview-page-error-request-count.png){.cInlineImage-small}

  This widget displays the total number of requests that have resulted in errors in your selected environment during the selected time range.

- **Average Error Rate**

  ![Average error rate](../assets/img//monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/overview-page-error-rate.png){.cInlineImage-small}

  This widget displays the average error rate (i.e., error count/total request count) of the selected environment for a given time interval. You can use this widget as an indicator to understand the health of the system. If the error rate is high, you can investigate further by clicking the arrow on the bottom right of the widget and opening the [**Errors**](#errors) page.

- **95th Percentile Latency**

  ![95th percentile latency](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/overview-page-latency.png){.cInlineImage-small}

  This widget displays the 95th percentile of all API latencies in your selected environment for the given time interval. You can use this widget to know whether the complete system operates under given SLAs. This metric provides the first indication of slow APIs. To investigate further, you can click the arrow on the bottom right of the widget to open the [**Latency**](#latency) page where you can further analyze the latency.

- **API Request Summary**

  ![API request summary](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/overview-page-timeline.png){.cInlineImage-full}

  This chart displays the total successful requests, the total requests that have resulted in errors, and the latency in a timeline. The y-axis on the left displays the request count and the error count. The x-axis shows time, and the y-axis on the right shows the latency in milliseconds. The granularity of the data points is decided based on the time range you have selected. The tooltip provides the exact value of all three metrics accurately.

### Traffic

The **Traffic** page shows information related to the traffic that goes through your API management deployments. This includes API usage, application usage, resource usage, etc. You can use this page to investigate the usage of APIs and applications, traffic patterns, etc.

![Traffic](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/traffic-page-full.png){.cInlineImage-full}

You can filter the information displayed in the widgets as follows:

| **Filtering Option** | **Description** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **By API**         | In the **API** field, you can select one or more APIs for which you want to view analytics. **All** is selected by default. Once you select an API, you can further filter by a specific application that uses the selected API via the **Application** field described below. |
| **By Application** | In the **Application** field, you can select the applications for which you want to view analytics. **All** is selected by default. The available applications are all the applications that have subscribed to one or more of the APIs you selected in the **API** field.|

You can view the following information for the APIs you have selected using the above filtering criteria:

- **API Usage Over Time**

  This timeline shows the count of API hits for the APIs for the filtered APIs. If multiple APIs are selected, the timeline shows each API in a separate line with a legend separating each line. You can also zoom in on a selected time range by selecting that area in the chart. To restore to the original view use the **Zoom out** button on the top right-hand corner of the plot.

  ![API usage over time](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/api-usage-timeline.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- **API Usage By Application**

  This widget shows the per-application breakdown of requests for the APIs you selected. You can use the pie chart view or the line chart view. You can switch between the two views using the small icon at the upper-right corner of the widget.

  ![API usage by application](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/usage-by-application.png){.cInlineImage-half}

- **API Usage By Target**

  This widget shows the per-backend breakdown of requests for the APIs you selected. This information is useful when multiple APIs share the same backend that has traffic restrictions. You can use these stats to scale your backends proactively. You can switch between the two views using the small icon at the upper-right corner of the widget.

  ![API usage by target](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/usage-by-target.png){.cInlineImage-half}

| **By Category** | The **Category** field is displayed when you click **Category** in the upper right corner of the page. In this field, you can select one or all of the following error categories:<br/>**Authentication**: Any kind of authentication error falls into this category including expired/missing/invalid credentials.<br/>**Target Connectivity**: Any kind of back-end error falls into this category including connection time-outs/other back-end errors (for example, 4xx and 5xx status codes).<br/>**Throttling**: Any request that fails due to rate-limiting falls into this category including application throttling/subscription throttling.<br/>**Other**: All other errors fall into this category including mediation errors/resource not found errors. |
| **By Status Code** | The **Status Code** field is displayed when you click **Status Code** in the upper right corner of the page. In this field, you can select all or any available HTTP status code category (4xx, 5xx, etc.). These status codes represent the response status of the API Gateway. |

#### Viewing errors by category

The following widgets are available for monitoring errors when you have selected **Category** in the upper-right corner of the page.

- This graph shows the error by category over time for the selected period. Apply the required filters as explained above to select the APIs and the error categories to which this content applies. When you select multiple APIs, the error count is grouped by category.

  ![Errors by category graph](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/error-category-graph.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- This table provides further information about the errors such as application details and the error reason. For some authentication errors, the application name is not available. You can use this table to get more concrete information about the errors related to your APIs and then start the problem identification.

  ![Errors by category table](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/error-category-table.png){.cInlineImage-full}

#### Viewing errors by status code

The following widgets are available for monitoring errors when you selected **Status Code** in the upper-right corner of the page.

- **Errors by Status Code**

  This graph shows the distribution of HTTP status codes received for errors over time for the selected period. Apply the required filters as explained above to select the APIs and status code groups to which this content applies. When you select multiple APIs, the error count is grouped by the status code.

  ![Errors by status code](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/error-by-status-code.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- **Target Errors by Status Code**

  This graph shows the distribution of target errors that have occurred during the selected time interval by HTTP status code. Apply the required filters as explained in the table above to view the APIs and status code groups to which this content applies. If you select multiple APIs, the widget groups the target error count by the status code.

  ![Target errors by status code](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/target-error-by-status-code.png){.cInlineImage-full}


- **Errors**

  The Errors heat map shows the HTTP response codes of errors sent to the client by the API Gateway. Each row displays the number of times the system returned each status code for the selected APIs. The cell color is red for higher numbers and white for lower numbers. If required, you can further filter the results by the error code groups you identified with the **Errors by Status Code** graph.

  ![Errors](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/error-heatmap.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- **Target Errors**

  The Target errors heat map shows the HTTP response codes of errors that the API Gateway received from the backend. Each row displays the number of times the system returned each status code for the selected APIs. The cell color is red for higher numbers and white for lower numbers. If required, you can further filter the results by the error code groups you identified with the **Target Errors by Status Code** graph.

  ![Target errors](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/target-error-heatmap.png){.cInlineImage-full}

### Latency

The **Latency** page shows information related to the latency of API calls within the API management deployment. You can view a summary of the slowest APIs and then drill down into the API view for further analysis. Use this page as a starting point to debug API slowness.

![Latency](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/latency-page-full.png){.cInlineImage-full}

The information displayed is as follows:

- **Top 10 Slowest APIs**

  This widget allows you to identify the slowest APIs of the API management system at a glance. Since these are the APIs that contribute to the higher 95th percentile of the system, improving these APIs lowers the 95th percentile of latency in the API Management deployments.

  ![Slowest APIs](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/slowest-apis.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- **Latencies By Category**

  This widget allows you to further drill down details in the above chart. Use the API selector in this widget to select the slow API you identified in the earlier step and then analyze further. Use the charts available in the widget to view the 95th percentile and the median latency over the selected period of the following:

    - Backend
    - Request mediation
    - Response mediation

  ![Latencies by category](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/latency-by-category.png){.cInlineImage-full}

  You can use these charts to further drill down and analyze whether the latency occurs in the backend, request mediation, or response mediation. Also, because you can see both the median and 95th percentile, you can easily identify whether the slowness is occurring in each request or whether it is intermittent.

### Cache

The **Cache** page shows statistics that indicate the efficiency with which response caching is carried out for the requests sent to your APIs.

![Cache statistics](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/cache-page-full.png){.cInlineImage-full}

The page displays the following statistics:

- **Cache Hit Percentage**

  This graph shows the percentage of requests the system has handled via the response cache over time and the total hits over time. This information allows you to assess how efficiently the backend handles API requests. For example, if the cache hit rate is low, it may indicate that the backend generates the same response each time a specific request is sent instead of returning the response via the cache. In such a scenario, there is scope to improve performance via response caching.

  ![Cache hit percentage](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/cache-statistics.png){.cInlineImage-full}

- **Latency**

  This section shows the total latency reported during the same time interval applied to the **Cache Hit Percentage** graph above.

  ![Cache hits and misses](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/cache-latency.png){.cInlineImage-full}

### Devices

The **Devices** page displays information about operating systems and HTTP agents that end users use to invoke the APIs. You can use this page to get an idea of the distribution of your user base and improve your APIs to match the audience.

![Device statistics](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/devices-page-full.png){.cInlineImage-full}

To filter the information displayed on this page by API, select the required API(s) in the **API** field. **All** is selected by default.

The information displayed is as follows:

- **Top Platforms**

  This chart shows the breakdown of the API clients by the operating system. The pie chart only shows platforms with a significant amount of requests. Other platforms are grouped under the **Other** category.

  ![Top platforms](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/top-platforms.png){.cInlineImage-half}

To filter the information displayed on this page by API, select the required API(s) in the **API** field. The default value is **All**.

This heat map highlights the countries with the appropriate color based on the hit count. It uses a relative color scale to depict the highest hit count to the lowest non-zero hit count.

![Geo Map Hit Scale](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/geomap-hit-count-scale.png){.cInlineImage-xsmall}

#### Viewing the number of requests by country

You can hold the pointer over the highlighted countries to view the country name and the total number of hits from that location. You can also use the mouse to zoom the map or pan it. Optionally, you can download geo map data in a tabular format using the PDF or CSV download options by clicking ![download](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/insights-download-report.svg) on the top right corner.

![Geo Map by country](../assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/api-insights/geomap-requests-by-country.png){.cInlineImage-half}

!!! Note
    -  Currently, this feature is only available for on-premise environments.
    - The geo-map page utilizes the IP address of the incoming request to derive the geolocation. The actual source IP address can be replaced if there are intermediate hosts between the client and the gateway node. Therefore, the reverse proxy or the load balancer fronting the gateway node must add the `x-forwarded-for` header to each request to preserve the source IP address. If you do not configure this correctly, the **Geo Map** page will not show any data. To test this, you can manually add an `x-forwarded-for` header to the request.

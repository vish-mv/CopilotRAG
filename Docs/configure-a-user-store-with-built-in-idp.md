# Configure a User Store with the Built-In Identity Provider

Developers looking to experiment with a complete application development process that includes user authentication and authorization can utilize Choreo's built-in identity provider (IdP). Choreo's built-in identity provider allows you to seamlessly test your application's authentication by setting up test users and groups within Choreo. 

!!! note
     Although the built-in IdP facilitates user management support, it is limited to adding users with attributes and groups. Therefore, the built-in IdP user management capabilities are not recommended for use in production.

## Prerequisites

Before you try out the steps in this guide, be sure you have administrator rights to your Choreo organization. This permission is essential to configure a user store with the built-in IdP.

## Configure a Choreo built-in IdP user store

Follow the steps given below to configure a Choreo built-in IdP user store for an environment:

1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/) and sign in.
2. In the Choreo Console top navigation menu, click the **Organization** list and then click on your organization.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**. This takes you to your organization settings.
4. Click the **Application Security** tab and then click the **Identity Providers** tab.
5. On the **Identity Providers** tab, click **Manage** in the **Choreo Built-in Identity Provider** pane.
6. In the Manage IdP pane, click on a specific environment tab depending on where you want to configure the built-in IdP user store.
7. You can download the sample **User store template file(.csv )** from the **User Store** section. The template file content is similar to the following:

   ```csv
   username,password,groups,first_name,last_name,email
   "demouser","password1","[manager, engineering]","John","Doe","john@acme.org"
   ```

   !!! note
       The provided template file contains a sample user with associated attributes. To include new users, insert extra rows in the .csv file. Also, expand the user attributes by adding more columns to the .csv file as needed.
   
8. Specify appropriate user details in the template file and save it.
9. Select the template file that you saved and click **Upload**. A successful upload creates the user store and displays the configured users in the **Users** section.
